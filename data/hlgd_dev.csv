0,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/26/worlds-first-gene-edited-babies-created-in-china-claims-scientist,"A scientist in China claims to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies, in a potentially ground-breaking and controversial medical first.
If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics. This kind of gene editing is banned in most countries as the technology is still experimental and DNA changes can pass to future generations, potentially with unforeseen side-effects.
Many mainstream scientists think it is too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.
The researcher, He Jiankui of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting so far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have: an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV.
He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they lived or where the work was done. There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts.
He revealed it on Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organisers of an international conference on gene editing that is due to begin on Tuesday, and earlier in interviews with the Associated Press.
“I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He said. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.
Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it. It was “unconscionable … an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene-editing expert.
“If true, this experiment is monstrous,” said Julian Savulescu, a professor of practical ethics at the University of Oxford. “The embryos were healthy. No known diseases. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.”
“There are many effective ways to prevent HIV in healthy individuals: for example, protected sex. And there are effective treatments if one does contract it. This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit. In many other places in the world, this would be illegal punishable by imprisonment.”
In recent years, scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called Crispr-Cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that is causing problems.
It has only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. If sperm, eggs or embryos were to be edited, the changes could then be inherited.
He Jiankui studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the US before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.
He said he practised editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods. He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a major problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes Aids, to enter a cell.
All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, he said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes. Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.
He said the gene editing occurred during in vitro fertilisation. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, in which HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene-editing tool was added. When the embryos were three to five days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.
Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no immediate evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV.
Musunuru said that even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes faced higher risks of contracting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it is treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern.
There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it, on 8 November. It is also unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits; for example, consent forms called the project an Aids vaccine development programme.
He said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing had never been tried before and carried risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18, and longer if they agree once they are adults.
“I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it caused unwanted side-effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility”.
Dr Sarah Chan, a bioethicist at the University of Edinburgh, said that if true, the experiment was “of grave ethical concern”.
“Whether or not the veracity of these reports is eventually borne out, making such claims in a way that seems deliberately designed to provoke maximum controversy and shock value is irresponsible and unethical,” she said.
“The claim made by those responsible for the research is that the babies have been genome edited in an attempt to make them immune to HIV. The lifetime risk of contracting HIV is extremely low in the first place; there are other means of prevention and it is no longer an incurable, inevitably terminal disease. Putting these children at such drastic risk for such a marginal gain is unjustifiable.”",0
1,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/28/scientist-in-china-defends-human-embryo-gene-editing,"The Chinese scientist who claims to have altered the DNA of twin girls before birth – without going through the usual scientific channels – said he was proud of his work, and claimed another woman enrolled in his trial was pregnant with a similarly modified baby.
The scientist, He Jiankui, spoke to hundreds of colleagues and journalists on Wednesday at the International Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
He said details of the first births from the trial, which used gene-editing technology known as Crispr-Cas9, had been submitted to a scientific journal, which he did not name. Nor did he say when the results might be published.
In a planned presentation, He, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology, in Shenzhen, described how he used Crispr-Cas9 to modify a gene called CCR5 in a number of embryos created through IVF for couples with HIV-positive fathers.
The modification was intended to mirror a natural mutation found in a small percentage of people which makes them resistant to the virus. Two girls named Nana and Lulu were born with the genetic changes, he said.
The researcher’s 40-minute Q&A offered a charged forum for scientists to publicly question a colleague caught in controversy.
The Nobel laureate David Baltimore, an organiser of the summit, who is professor emeritus of biology at the California Institute of Technology, called He’s work irresponsible. “I think there has been a failure of self regulation by the scientific community because of a lack of transparency,” Baltimore said.
David Liu, a biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, challenged He on how the girls might benefit from having their DNA altered. The children were not at risk of contracting HIV at birth and he said there were many ways to avoid HIV infection later in life. “What was the unmet medical need for these patients in particular?” Liu asked.
He said in defence: “I truly believe that, not only for this case but for millions of children, they need this protection since an HIV vaccine is not available. For this case I feel proud.”
Matthew Porteus, professor of paediatrics at Stanford University, said: “He’s already at risk of becoming a pariah.” Scientists talked about their research plans years in advance with many colleagues, to get feedback before they set out. “Unless he starts to engage in the scientific process, it will get worse and worse,” Porteus added.
At the summit He presented slides to an audience of scientists who expressed concern that he could have brought harm to his subjects and jeopardised gene editing research.
The scientist said, however, he wanted to prevent HIV being inherited from a parent because so many children were affected by the virus in China. Eight couples had agreed to take part in the study, though one had dropped out. With each, the father was HIV positive, while the woman was clear of the virus.
He told the audience he had worked on 31 eggs and implanted two altered embryos in one woman. One of the babies had only one copy of the CCR5 gene edited, which was not enough to confer HIV resistance. The health of both children would be monitored for the next 18 years.
The gene-editing work had started three years ago, partly paid for by He, who had consulted, he said, with just a few colleagues about his plans.
In the UK and many other countries it is illegal to create genetically modified babies, and scientists in the field have reached a broad consensus that it would be deeply unethical to try. Genome editing is not considered safe, and any genetic modifications – whether beneficial or unintentionally harmful – affect not only the child, but their children and future generations.
“It is impossible to overstate how irresponsible, unethical and dangerous this is at the moment,” said Kathy Niakan, a scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, who was present at the summit. “There was a worrying lack of oversight or scrutiny of his clinical plans before he started human experiments and a complete lack of transparency throughout the process.
“I found it highly troubling that He avoided questions about approval processes, and his answers on patient recruitment and consent did not reassure me. The team don’t seem to have had adequate training on proper consent processes. Offering vulnerable patients free IVF treatment presents a clear conflict of interest.”
On Tuesday it was announced that He’s work was being investigated by Chinese officials and his university in Shenzhen.
He’s vague answers at the summit prompted more questions from the audience. Did He know enough about the technology to ensure that the children would be healthy, or might they contract other deadly viruses? He insisted he did know enough.
“How do you see your responsibility to these children?” asked Eben Kirksey, an associate professor of anthropology, at Deakin University, in Victoria, Australia. He replied that the children’s medical care would be provided for, but offered no details.
The missing information frustrated many in the audience. “This is a red line,” one conference attendee told He. “Why did you choose to cross it and conduct this in secret?”
Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, claimed that He was misguided. “He clearly made some wrong decisions. I’m very critical of calling this a scientific breakthrough because he’s messed up all along.”
Lovell-Badge said he was inclined to believe that He had altered the babies’ DNA, but said the scientist needed to show proof of it. The only way to convince the world would be if an independent, qualified, lab tested the DNA of the parents and the two babies to show that the genes had been edited. “Nothing that I’ve been shown says it’s false. But the evidence I’ve seen is not yet good enough,” he added.",0
2,http://www.reuters.com/article/space-station-crew-idUSL1N1HS03X,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., April 20 (Reuters) - A scaled-down, two-man U.S.-Russian crew blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday for a six-hour ride to the International Space Station, a NASA TV broadcast showed.
A Russian Soyuz capsule carrying NASA astronaut Jack Fischer, 43, and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, 58, lifted off at 1:13 p.m. local time/3:13 a.m. EDT (0713 GMT) with a rare empty third seat. Russia is scaling back space station staffing until its long-delayed science laboratory is flown to the orbiting outpost next year.
Fischer and Yurchikhin were scheduled to reach the $100 billion space station, which orbits about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, at 9:23 a.m. EDT (1323 GMT).
Fischer said he suspects the biggest challenge he faces in his first voyage into space will be learning how to use the station’s zero-gravity toilet.
“It’s all about suction, it’s really difficult,” Fischer said in a NASA interview before launch. “You just can’t train for that on the ground, so I approach my space-toilet activities with respect, preparation and a healthy dose of sheer terror.”
The rookie astronaut will be sharing the station with two seasoned veterans.
Soyuz crewmate Yurchikhin has made four previous spaceflights. Station commander Peggy Whitson, 57, in the midst of her third long-duration mission, is due on Monday to beat the 534-day record for cumulative time spent in space by a U.S. astronaut.
She is expected to receive a congratulatory phone call on Monday from U.S. President Donald Trump, NASA said on Wednesday.
Whitson, who flew to the station in November along with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, will remain aboard with Fischer and Yurchikhin until September. (Editing by Steve Gorman and Louise Ireland)",1
3,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-china-babies-panel/chinese-geneticist-reveals-another-potential-gene-edited-pregnancy-idUSKCN1NX0EM?feedType=RSS&feedName;=scienceNews,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist at the center of an ethical storm over what he claims are the world’s first genetically edited babies said on Wednesday he is proud of his work and revealed there was a second “potential” pregnancy as part of the research.
He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
“For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,” He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.
Asked whether there were any other edited gene pregnancies as part of his trials, He said there was another “potential” pregnancy and replied “yes” to a follow-up question as to whether it was a “chemical pregnancy”, which refers to an early-stage miscarriage.
It was unclear whether the pregnancy had ended or not.
He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.
“This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,” He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organizers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.

The Chinese Society for Cell Biology in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes and said that it was against the law and medical ethics of China.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. “Pandora’s box has been opened,” they said.
INFORMED CONSENT
He, who said he was against gene enhancement, said eight couples were initially enrolled for his study while one dropped out. The criteria required the father to be HIV positive and the mother to be HIV negative.
Scientists at the conference pressed He to prove that those taking part in the trial were aware of all the risks involved in the process.
He said that all the participants had a “good education background” and went through two rounds of discussions with him and his team.
A 23-page English translation of an informed consent form for the potential mother said that the costs of the procedure covered by the team would be up to 280,000 yuan ($40,200) per couple.
The consent form mentions multiple risks, but there is little detail on potential complications of the gene-editing process itself, including for the child. It does not mention that such an experiment has never been done before.
David Baltimore, President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, spoke after He’s speech, saying it was irresponsible to have proceeded until safety issues were in order.
“I don’t think it has been a transparent process. Only found out about it after it happened and the children were born,” Baltimore said.
He Jiankui said his results could be used for millions of people with inherited diseases. He said he would monitor the two newborns for the next 18 years and hoped they would support continued monitoring thereafter.
Shenzhen Harmonicare Medical Holdings Limited 1509.HK, named as being involved in He's project in China's clinical trial registry, sought to distance itself by stating the hospital never participated in any operations relating to the gene-edited babies and no related delivery had taken place.
In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, the group said preliminary investigations indicated the signatures on the application form circulated on the internet are “suspected to have been forged, and no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”.
The Guangdong province Health Commission announced on its website on Wednesday that it and Shenzhen city had set up a joint team to investigate the case.

4,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/after-an-extended-quarantine-the-next-iss-crew-arrives-in-orbit/,"Working from home is easy for some and difficult for others, but one place it’s downright impossible is the International Space Station. So pandemic or no pandemic, the latest crew had to get themselves up there. They’ve just had a successful launch and arrival, but only after a protracted quarantine period.
To be clear, ISS crews are always quarantined prior to launch to make sure they don’t bring the flu up from a chance encounter, but given the coronavirus situation, this was a special occasion.
Update: Although some extra measures were taken, the quarantine was no longer than normal, NASA says. The crew went through a standard two-week quarantine in their quarters, while staff adhered to extra-rigorous infection control at the Roscosmos launch facility in Baikonur. They were not tested for coronavirus. I’ve attached NASA’s full statement regarding the mission’s quarantine procedures at the bottom of the article.
Expedition 63 will relieve the current crew after about a week of overlap, during which no doubt the ISS begins to feel fairly crowded.
This crew is special in that among its duties will be to welcome the astronauts aboard the first Commercial Crew mission to the ISS, who will arrive on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. That mission, too, is currently on schedule for May despite the pandemic.
Every crew mission for years has been done using Russia’s venerable Soyuz spacecraft. These have been updated continually for decades, but still feature more than a little of what might best be described as “repeatedly flight proven” technology.
The effort to engineer a state of the art spacecraft for crewed missions has lasted several years, coming down to SpaceX and rival Boeing in the home stretch. But while both have suffered repeated delays, Boeing has had numerous other failures that have pushed its launch out toward the end of the year and perhaps beyond. SpaceX, on the other hand, is ready to go.
The first Commercial Crew mission, whether it’s next month or a little later, will be the culmination of years of competition, and the first time a crew has gone to orbit in an American-made spacecraft since the Shuttle was retired. (Virgin Galactic has piloted its spacecraft to the edge of space, but its human-rated craft is not an orbital vehicle.)
If all goes well, NASA’s Chris Cassidy and Roscosmos’s Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will welcome the historic mission to the ISS soon.
Here’s NASA’s statement on astronaut health and quarantine:
NASA has a robust plan in place to ensure astronauts are not ill or incubating illnesses when they launch to the International Space Station. The space program takes an extremely conservative approach toward infection control so once our crew members arrive at the space station, the risk is as low as possible. All of our crew must stay in quarantine for two weeks before they launch. This ensures that they aren’t sick or incubating an illness when they get to the space station and is called “health stabilization.” NASA and Roscosmos used the standard quarantine period of two weeks for the Soyuz crew.
To prevent any illness before an astronaut goes into quarantine, NASA is closely adhering to the CDC’s recommendations on infection control for the coronavirus. This includes cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, and limiting contact with crew members. During quarantine, the astronauts live in their crew quarters – NASA has crew quarters for this purpose at Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers, and Roscosmos has them in Baikonur. They don’t have direct contact with anyone who has not been pre-cleared by NASA flight surgeons. The time is spent preparing for flight, studying and resting, as well as working out and making video calls to friends and family members.
The 2010 Flight Crew Heath Stabilization Program reflects a preflight quarantine period from the legacy space shuttle program. The Russian program has always implemented a two-week quarantine, and this has applied to all space station partner crew members that have flown on the Soyuz, including American astronauts. In 2011 the space station medical community converged on a common preflight infectious disease control plan, which included a two-week quarantine period along with other measures. This applies to all personnel flying to the space station, which includes the new US commercial vehicles.
Chris Cassidy and his Soyuz crewmates were not tested for coronavirus. They have been under strict quarantine procedures ahead of their launch and no members of their support team in Baikonur have shown any symptoms or fevers.",1

He was calling up the Space Station to congratulate Ms Whitson for her record-beating stay in Space: she's been up there for more than 534 days, which was the previous record.
The President congratulated her via video link from the Oval Office alongside his daughter, Ivanka, and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins.
He said: ""All over we have astronauts and we have everybody who are flying right now 17,000 miles per hour.
""That's about as fast as I've ever heard, I wouldn't want to fly 17,000 miles an hour but that's what you have to do.
""534 days in space - that's an incredible record to break, and on behalf of our country and on behalf of the world we would like to congratulate you"".
Appearing to forget he had signed a bill directing Nasa to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s, Mr Trump asked: ""Tell me, Mars, what do you see a timing for actually sending humans to Mars?""
Politely, Ms Whitson replied: ""Well, I think as your bill directed it will be approximately in the 2030s"".
Mr Trump said: ""We want to do it during my first term and at worst during my second term so we want to speed that up, OK? ""
The President also expressed disgust about the drinking habits of astronauts in the International Space Station.
“Water is such a precious resource up here that we also are cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable. And it’s really not as bad as it sounds,” Ms Whitson said.
Grimacing, he replied: ""That's good, I'm glad to hear that. Better you than me.""",1
6,https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/14/nasas-orion-spacecraft-completes-testing-ahead-of-artemis-1-moon-mission/,"NASA has completed the testing process meant to simulate performance in in-space conditions for its Orion crew spacecraft, developed by Lockheed Martin and designed to carry crew on the agency’s Artemis missions. The missions aim to return the next American man and deliver the first American woman to the surface of the Moon. It reportedly “aced” the tests according to NASA, which include thermal vacuum and electromagnetic interference performance checks.
Obviously, it’s not business as usual at NASA amid the ongoing coronavirus situation (it isn’t business as usual anywhere), but NASA still managed to finish up the testing it needed to do at its Glenn research facility in Ohio. Glenn is the site of world-leading testing facilities that simulate flight conditions, including wind tunnels and vacuum chambers, and Orion’s testing completion at the facility means it’s now ready to move on to NASA Kennedy and Florida.
It’ll fly to Kennedy aboard NASA’s Super Guppy aircraft, which is a specially-built cargo aircraft with an extremely wide body designed for the purposes of transporting larger-than-normal cargo just like the Lockheed-built Orion capsule.
NASA in general appears to be progressing with its preparations for both Artemis, as well as for other ongoing key programs like its Commercial Crew program, which will see privately operated rockets fly astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time.
It has taken additional precautions to ensure the health of its astronauts meant to fly on the first crewed Commercial Crew mission, however, and its NASA Marshall facility also announced today that it’s limiting access to “mission-essential personnel” after one staff member tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday night.",1

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the globe, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told Fox News the space agency will ""continue to assess the potential impact on our missions as the situation unfolds.""
In an email to Fox News, Bridenstine said the agency's main priority is the safety of its workers -- while noting the benefits of space exploration to the U.S. economy.
""NASA’s number one priority right now is taking the steps needed to protect and care for the NASA team, which is critical to the success of our missions,"" Bridenstine said. ""We will continue to assess the potential impact on our missions as the situation unfolds.""
CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: WHERE DOES IT STAND?
Bridenstine continued: ""Space exploration has been an economic driver for the U.S. economy, creating tens of thousands of jobs, reducing our trade deficit, and inspiring countless Americans to pursue careers in STEM fields. The Artemis program as part of America’s Moon to Mars exploration approach will continue that long tradition, growing our economy and improving life on Earth for generations to come.""
On March 19, Bridenstine announced the agency’s Michoud Assembly Facility and Stennis Space Center in New Orleans and Mississippi, respectively, would move to Stage 4, closing all facilities and forcing mandatory telework, putting the 2024 timeframe of a return to the moon in jeopardy.
""The NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,"" the former Oklahoma congressman turned NASA Administrator said in the March 19 statement. ""Once this is complete, personnel allowed onsite will be limited to those needed to protect life and critical infrastructure.""
NASA had recently moved the entire agency to Stage 3, which still allowed for ""mission essential personnel"" to appear at the centers. The decision to change Stennis's status was made ""due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the community around the center, the number of self-isolation cases within our workforce there, and one confirmed case among our Stennis team,"" Bridenstine said last week.
TOP CORONAVIRUS SCAMS TO BE AWARE OF
Separately, NASA issued a statement on its website on March 20 that its Perseverance rover is a ""high priority"" for the agency, noting the mission will continue as is.
""Much of the work is being done by employees and contractors who work remotely across the agency. Assessments by agency leadership are underway for anyone required to work in areas under restriction, such as NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, especially after the recent announcement by California’s governor,"" NASA wrote in the statement issued late Friday.
However, the fate of the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope, slated to launch in March 2021, is up in the air. The government agency also said it would suspend ""integration and testing operations"" to ensure ""the safety of the workforce."" The James Webb Telescope is the planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in operation for more than 29 years.

Turkey and all the trimmings are a staple for Americans on Thanksgiving, and that doesn't have to change for Americans in space.
Astronaut food has come a long way from the early days of human spaceflight, and crewmembers on the International Space Station these days can enjoy many Turkey Day traditions, such as cornbread stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, cherry blueberry cobbler, and, of course, turkey itself.
This year, NASA astronaut Kevin Ford, commander of the space station's Expedition 34 mission, will celebrate with his Russian crewmates Evgeny Tarelkin and Oleg Novitskiy.
""Thanksgiving is not a holiday that the Russians celebrate, but we have found that on orbit the crewmembers celebrate each others' holidays,"" said Vickie Kloeris, manager of the Space Food Systems Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""They will take part in Kevin Ford's celebration of Thanksgiving, just as American crewmembers will take part in some of the Russian holidays."" [Thanksgiving Feast in Space - The Menue (Video)]
The space station's Thanksgiving delicacies will come in somewhat different forms than what may be on most holiday tables, though. Space food falls into two categories: freeze-dried (just add water) or thermostabilized (comes in a pouch). And all food sent to the space station has to meet certain microbiological requirements and have a sufficient shelf life.
For example, the cornbread dressing on offer is a replacement for the traditional bread-based stuffing that many people are used to. However, break makes too many crumbs that float around in all directions in weightlessness and are difficult to clean up.
Still, the current Thanksgiving menu is a huge improvement over what earlier space travelers had available.
""If you want to go all the way back to Mercury and Gemini, there were no holiday meals back then,"" Kloeris told SPACE.com. ""All you had was cube foods and tube foods. We've definitely expanded greatly the amount of traditional items that we have made available for holiday times, and that only makes sense because when we started having crewmembers stay on space station long term, we knew every year we'd be hitting Thanksgiving and Christmas with somebody.""
In addition to the standard holiday menu items, each astronaut gets a certain number of ""bonus containers"" to pack whatever particular foods they'd like, provided they meet the basic requirements. Most pack off-the-shelf products like cookies and other treats.
""We have crewmembers who take icing in tubs and cookies, and they’ll ice them at Christmas time,"" Kloeris said. ""We've even had crewmembers take food coloring so they could color the icing.""
The importance of having traditional holiday foods varies from crewmember to crewmember, she said. ""That's always evident when they go to plan their bonus containers. You immediately know who has the strongest ties to holiday food because they’ll be the first ones to bring up the fact that, 'Hey, I'm going to be up there at Christmas.'""
Each of the holiday foods that are provided by NASA have made it through a thorough vetting process.
It starts with a basic recipe for, say, cherry blueberry cobbler. Then the NASA food scientists modify the recipe so that it can be packed in pouches, which is similar to canning. After that, they test its texture, color, and taste.
""When it goes through the thermostabilizing process, the chemistry of the food changes quite a bit,"" Kloeris said. ""Often what happens is we'll take a formulation and we'll try it afterwards, and it's like, 'No, that’s not acceptable.'""
The scientists often have to go through many iterations of a recipe, including scaling it up so it still tastes good if made in large batches, before a food is ready for orbit. And some recipes just never quite make it.

ALMATY, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A Russian Soyuz capsule landed on the Kazakh steppe on Monday, safely delivering a trio of astronauts from a four-month stint aboard the International Space Station.
The Soyuz TMA-05M capsule, carrying Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, parachuted through dark, cloudy skies and touched down at 7:56 a.m. local time (0156 GMT).
A round of applause greeted the landing at Russian mission control near Moscow, footage from NASA TV showed. A screen inside the building showed the message: “We have landing!”
The capsule blazed a red plasma trail across the dark sky after re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere. It landed on its side on the snow-covered steppe 52 miles (83 km) northeast of the town of Arkalyk in northern Kazakhstan.
The astronauts were extracted quickly from the capsule and wrapped in blue thermal blankets. All three smiled and appeared relaxed as they chatted with the search-and-recovery team, NASA TV footage showed.
“Fresh air - very good!” Williams said, in Russian. The landing, after a three-and-a-half-hour descent from the orbital outpost, was the first pre-dawn touchdown since 2006.
The Expedition 33 crew had spent 125 days aboard the International Space Station, a $100 billion research complex involving 15 countries and orbiting 250 miles (410 km) above Earth.
The crew conducted a number of experiments, including tests on radiation levels at the space station and research into the effects of melting glaciers and seasonal changes on Earth’s ecosystems, NASA said in a statement.
They also managed several visits to the space station by international and commercial spacecraft and conducted several space walks to maintain the station.
A three-man crew remains aboard the space station. When NASA’s Kevin Ford and rookie cosmonauts Oleg Novitsky and Yevgeny Tarelkin - both on their first space mission - docked on Oct. 25, they brought with them Japanese fish for a variety of experiments.
They are scheduled to be joined by another trio - Canadian Chris Hadfield, U.S. astronaut Tom Marshburn and cosmonaut Roman Romanenko - who are due to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Dec. 19.
Monday’s smooth landing will help to ease concerns over Russia’s space programme following a string of recent mishaps.
The Soviet Union put the first satellite and the first man in space, but Moscow’s space programme has suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in recent months that industry veterans blame on a decade of crimped budgets and a brain drain.
While none of the mishaps have threatened crews, they have raised worries over Russia’s reliability, cost billions of dollars in satellite losses and dashed Moscow’s dreams of ending its more than two-decade absence from deep-space exploration.
Since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttles last year, the United States is dependent on Russia to fly astronauts at a cost to the nation of $60 million per person. (Reporting by Robin Paxton; editing by Philip Barbara and Christopher Wilson)",1
10,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/scott-kelly-twins-study-nasa.html,"4 Takeaways From That Huge Study of Scott Kelly
There’s never been a study like it before, and there probably never will be again.
Starting in March 2015, astronaut Scott Kelly spent 340 days aboard the International Space Station. A team of scientists tracked his body’s responses to long-term spaceflight in painstaking detail. They simultaneously tracked his identical twin brother, Mark, on Earth.
On Thursday, the scientists began publishing the huge trove of results from the so-called NASA Twins Study — 90 pages, all told, and that’s just the first installment. Here’s a guide to what they’ve found … so far.
[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]
Space travel changes the body.
Scientists tracked a huge range of measurements in the NASA Twins Study, from Mr. Kelly’s performance on cognition tests to levels of gene activity in his cells. Many of the molecular tests had never been carried out on astronauts before.
The exams required Mr. Kelly to draw his own blood and to send fresh samples back to Earth in a Soyuz supply craft. Within 48 hours, researchers were analyzing the samples at NASA labs.
In one test, researchers broke open Mr. Kelly’s white blood cells and searched for molecular signals from each of his genes to see whether they were active. The scientists identified thousands of genes that ramped up their pace.
By looking at what those genes do, the team gleaned some clues as to why they became active in Mr. Kelly. Some are known to be triggered by stress, so it was no surprise to find that Mr. Kelly’s immune system also was on high alert.
In another test, the researchers scrutinized molecular caps on the ends of Mr. Kelly’s chromosomes, called telomeres. Telomeres shorten with age, and stress can shorten them further. But Mr. Kelly’s telomeres actually grew longer on average during his time in space.
But it’s not clear what the changes mean.
Human biology is complicated and mysterious, even here on Earth. So documenting changes that Mr. Kelly experienced in space won’t automatically help scientists understand the causes.
For example, why did his telomeres get longer? The Twins Study researchers are still trying to figure it out. It might have something to do with Mr. Kelly’s carefully designed, nutrient-rich diet — or perhaps the stress of space travel triggered stem cells to wake up and start multiplying.
Another mystery lies in the very design of the experiment. NASA only examined a single astronaut in space, comparing his responses to his genetically identical brother. It’s hard to know if all astronauts would experience the same changes — or if some of those changes are flukes of his own experience and genetic makeup.
The most worrisome findings: genetic mutations and lower scores on cognition tests.
Radiation can trigger certain mutations that may increase a person’s risk of developing cancer. And there’s more radiation in Earth orbit than on the surface of the planet.
In his 340 days aboard the space station, Mr. Kelly was exposed to an estimated 48 times more radiation than he would have been subjected to had he spent a year on the planet.
Scientists were able to observe the appearance of radiation-induced mutations in Mr. Kelly’s cells. The mutations were still present in Mr. Kelly months after his return, suggesting that he’ll carry them forward in his life, possibly causing a modest increase in his risk of cancer.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]
So it’s a bit worrying that a long-term trip to Mars would expose astronauts to eight times more radiation than Mr. Kelly received.
In addition, Mr. Kelly did worse on cognition tests even six months after landing, making more mistakes and responding more slowly. It’s possible that the physical demands of spaceflight were to blame, or that unconsciously his motivation had decreased.
These unexpected declines led some researchers to worry about how ready astronauts would be for a challenging landing on Mars after many months in deep space.
If we attempt a trip to Mars, we’ll need to prepare.
NASA understands that long-duration spaceflight could pose serious challenges to astronauts. By studying those challenges aboard the space station, the agency has been trying to quantify those risks. And on Earth, scientists have been investigating potential countermeasures.
Take radiation. On the space station, Mr. Kelly’s cells switched on genes known to help repair DNA. It’s possible that his cells actually undid a lot of mutations right after they arose. Researchers are investigating a variety of compounds that might spur the cells of astronauts to repair even more damage.
But such drugs might not be enough to handle, say, an unexpected solar flare, which would spray vast amounts of radiation. Some experts have speculated that spaceships would need a shielded room where astronauts could hide until flares were over.
Although that might protect astronauts in theory, it would also add a lot of extra weight to a mission to Mars. And that’s just one of the biological risks that scientists will have to plan for.",1
11,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gene-editing-summit-idUSKBN0TL02V20151202?feedType=RSS&feedName=scienceNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Debate over the use of powerful new gene editing tools in human eggs, sperm and embryos grew heated on Tuesday as scientists and ethicists gathered at an international summit to discuss the technology, which has the power to change the DNA of unborn children.
Several groups have already called for restrictions on use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9, which has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.
Hille Haker, chair of Catholic Moral Theology at Loyola University Chicago, argued on Tuesday in favor of a two-year international ban on research that involves changing human reproductive cells, also known as germline cells. Such changes would be passed on to offspring.
She argued that such practices violated the freedom of unborn children, who would not have an opportunity to consent to changes in their genetic code.
But John Harris, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester in Britain, argued strongly in favor of the technology.
“We all have an inescapable moral duty: To continue with scientific investigation to the point at which we can make a rational choice. We are not yet at that point. It seems to me, consideration of a moratorium is the wrong course. Research is necessary,” Harris said.
CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.
Advocates have said the technology can speed the day that scientists can prevent hereditary diseases. Opponents worry about unknown effects on future generations and the temptation for future parents to pay for genetic enhancements such as greater intelligence or athletic ability.
There appeared to be broad agreement at the meeting that “somatic” cell editing, in which the changes are done in non-reproductive cells and are not passed along, posed few risks.
Some scientists believe it is already too late to ban any use of the technology in human reproductive cells because the technology is easily accessible and in widespread use in many labs.
“It’s just not feasible,” Debra Mathews of Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics told a news briefing on Monday.
But researchers and the growing field of well-funded start-up companies that hope to commercialize the technology are clearly worried about possible regulations.
Two of those companies, Intellia Therapeutics and CRISPR Therapeutics, issued a joint statement on Tuesday pledging not to use the new tools to edit human eggs, sperm or embryos.
Nessan Bermingham, chief executive and founder of Intellia Therapeutics based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the discussion over the use of gene editing was very important but also very early.
“Our understanding of the germline is in its infancy,” Bermingham said, adding that scientists’ understanding of inherited disorders involving a single gene were much better understood and comprised the area of the greatest medical need.
The three-day Washington meeting was convened by the National Academies of Medicine and Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of the United Kingdom

12,https://www.france24.com/en/20181128-genetics-summit-holds-breath-chinese-baby-editing-details,"Organisers of a conference that has been upended by gene-edited baby revelations are holding their breath as to what the controversial scientist at the centre of the ""breakthrough"" will say when he takes the stage.
Chinese scientist He Jiankui is due to speak Wednesday at a summit of biomedical experts in Hong Kong, just days after publishing claims to have created the world's first genetically-edited babies.
In a video posted on YouTube, university professor He said that the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had had their DNA altered to prevent them from contracting HIV.
The move -- which would be a medical first if true -- prompted a heated debate among the scientific community, with many raising concerns over the lack of verified data and exposing healthy embryos and children to gene editing.
Organisers of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, which opened Tuesday, also appeared to have been unaware of He's work.
Biologist and summit chair David Baltimore told AFP on the sidelines of the conference that he had ""no idea whether (He is) reliable or not"".
""I haven't seen any of the research and I don't know what he is planning to claim,"" Baltimore said.
Keynote speakers were mobbed by the press on the opening day, after the conference drew international attention on the back of the gene baby revelations.
John Christodoulou, chair of genomic medicine at the University of Melbourne, said it seemed the research had ""bypassed the usual ethical regulatory processes"".
""But if what he has done is to edit human embryos, and for them to be carried through to birth... there is a real risk of so-called off-target effects,"" he added.
""The technology can create mutations or break chromosomes in other areas apart from where we're hoping it's being targeted.""
Margaret Sleeboom-Faulkner from the University of Sussex told AFP Tuesday that ""it will be very wise to make sure that this shouldn't happen as a standard"".
He, who was educated at Stanford University and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said the twins' DNA was modified using CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
Gene editing is a potential fix for heritable diseases but it is extremely controversial because the changes would be passed down to future generations and could eventually affect the entire gene pool.
- 'Immediate investigation' -
Qiu Renzong, formerly the vice president of the Chinese Ministry of Health's ethics committee, told reporters at the gene editing conference that lax regulations in China mean that scientists who break the rules often face no punishment, and think of the ministry as being ""without teeth"".
He Jiankui is due to join a panel discussion Wednesday and speak Thursday on developing moral principles and safety standards in human gene editing.
But as sceptical experts cast doubt over the claimed breakthrough, his research came under fire on a number of other fronts too.
China's National Health Commission ordered an ""immediate investigation"" into the case, the official Xinhua news agency reported, while the Shenzhen hospital meant to have approved the research programme denied its involvement.
The university where He works also distanced itself -- saying he had been on unpaid leave since February -- and called his claims a ""serious violation of academic ethics and norms"".
He did not respond to a request for comment from AFP.
The issue of editing human DNA is highly controversial, and in many countries is tightly controlled.
But this is not the first time Chinese researchers have experimented with human embryo technology.
Last September, scientists at Sun Yat-sen University used an adapted version of gene-editing to correct a disease-causing mutation in human embryos.
There is also a history of fraud within China's academic community -- including a scandal last year that led to the withdrawal of 100 ""compromised"" academic papers.
A joint statement Monday from a group of 100 scientists in China criticised He Jiankui's claims and called them a ""great blow to the global reputation and development of biomedical research in China"".

Economists anxiously await jobless claims figure
More tough economic news is likely on tap Thursday when the Labor Department reports unemployment claims for the week ending April 4. A stunning 10 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits in the past two weeks, reflecting the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis. That figure exceeds the nearly 9 million who lost jobs from 2008 to 2010 amid the Great Recession. And more is still to come, experts say: Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics expects a total of 22 million job losses by May, pushing the historically low 3.5% unemployment rate to 12% before the outbreak eases.

Americans could start receiving stimulus checks today
Millions of taxpayers could begin receiving the much-awaited stimulus cash by direct deposit as early as Thursday. The first group — estimated to cover 50 million to 60 million Americans — would include people who have already given their bank account information to the IRS. The group also would include Social Security beneficiaries who filed federal tax returns that included direct deposit information, according to an alert from Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell. Her announcement said the expectation is that the first direct deposits would hit in mid-April, likely the week beginning April 13.

Astronauts blast off for ISS despite pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic is forcing people to stay home, but three astronauts on Thursday will experience a different type of isolation and quarantine — in space. NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and his fellow crewmates, Russia's Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, blasted off aboard the Soyuz MS-16 spacecraft at 4:05 a.m. ET from Kazakhstan. They'll take a six-hour journey to the International Space Station, where they will join Expedition 62 crew members Oleg Skripochka, Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir, who will return to Earth on April 17. Russian space officials have taken extra precautions to protect the crew during training and pre-flight preparations. Speaking to journalists via video link Wednesday, Cassidy said the crew has been in “a very strict quarantine” for the past month and so in good health. “We all feel fantastic,” he said.

14,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/30/chinese-doctor-claimed-first-genetically-edited-baby-jailed/,"A Chinese scientist who set off an ethical debate with claims that he had made the world's first genetically edited babies was sentenced Monday to three years in prison because of his research, state media said.
He Jiankui, who was convicted of practicing medicine without a license, was also fined 3 million yuan ($430,000) by a court in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, China's official Xinhua News Agency said.
Two other researchers involved in the project received lesser sentences and fines. Zhang Renli was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1 million yuan. Qin Jinzhou received an 18-month sentence, but with a two-year reprieve, and a 500,000 yuan fine.
He, the lead researcher, shocked the scientific world when he announced in November 2018 that he had altered the embryos of twin girls who had been born the same month. He described his work in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.
The announcement sparked a global debate over the ethics of gene editing. He said he had used a tool called CRISPR to try to disable a gene that allows the AIDS virus to enter a cell, in a bid to give the girls the ability to resist the infection. The identity of the girls has not been released, and it isn't clear if the experiment succeeded.
The CRISPR tool has been tested elsewhere in adults to treat diseases, but many in the scientific community denounced He's work as medically unnecessary and unethical, because any genetic changes could be passed down to future generations. The U.S. forbids editing embryos except for lab research.
He told the AP in 2018 that he felt a strong responsibility to make an example, and that society would decide whether to allow the practice to go forward. He disappeared from public view shortly after he announced his research at a conference in Hong Kong 13 months ago, apparently detained by authorities initially in an apartment in Shenzhen.
The Xinhua report, citing the court's verdict, said the researchers were involved in the births of three gene-edited babies to two women, confirming reports of a third baby.
The court said the three researchers had not obtained qualification as doctors to practice medicine, pursued fame and profits, deliberately violated Chinese regulations on scientific research and crossed an ethical line in both scientific research and medicine. It also said they had fabricated ethical review documents.
He studied in the U.S. before setting up a lab at the Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, a city in Guangdong province that borders Hong Kong. The verdict accused him of colluding with Zhang and Qin, who worked at medical institutes in the same province.",0
15,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/science/nasa-orion-spacecraft-lifts-off-into-orbit.html,"First Flight Test Is Successful for NASA’s Orion Spacecraft
NASA’s new Orion spacecraft passed its first flight test on Friday, marking the start of what the space agency hopes will be a new era of human exploration beyond Earth’s orbit.
Carrying only test equipment and some souvenirs, the 19,000-pound capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 600 miles southwest of San Diego about four and a half hours after it was launched into orbit from Florida. NASA said that the spacecraft had functioned nearly flawlessly throughout the brief flight and that the capsule landed just a mile off target.
“There is your new spacecraft, America,” a NASA spokesman, Rob Navias, said as Orion gently descended, its three main orange-and-white parachutes framed against wispy clouds in an otherwise blue sky.
“It’s a good day,” W. Michael Hawes, Orion program manager for Lockheed Martin, which built Orion, said at a news conference in Florida two hours after splashdown.
For the space industry, public and private, the test was a welcome success after two recent disasters. In late October, a commercial cargo rocket bound for the International Space Station exploded after liftoff in Virginia. Two days later, a rocket being developed by Virgin Galactic to take private citizens on short space jaunts disintegrated during a test flight in California, killing a pilot.
NASA’s test, though, appeared to go off with just a few minor hitches. One of the few reported problems occurred after the splashdown, when two of five airbags designed to keep the capsule upright in the water did not fully deploy. But the failure had no effect on the recovery.
The 11-foot-long capsule, which had slowed from a maximum speed of about 20,000 miles an hour to 20 just before it splashed into the water, will be towed to San Diego and eventually trucked back to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Engineers and technicians will pore over it and analyze reams of data collected by sensors during the flight to determine how well the spacecraft’s systems and parts, including the capsule’s heat shield, performed.
William H. Gerstenmaier, a NASA associate administrator, said that a quick review after the splashdown suggested that the data “looks really good.”
“We will really learn things from this flight,” he said.
Sitting atop a Delta IV rocket, the Orion capsule lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida’s Atlantic coast at 7:05 a.m. The launch had been delayed for a day after winds and a problem with the rocket’s fuel system forced a cancellation on Thursday.
With two boosts from the Delta rocket’s second-stage engine, Orion circled Earth for two orbits, the second one carrying it to an altitude of 3,604 miles so it could achieve a high re-entry speed, close to the speeds expected if it were to return from a flight to the moon or beyond.
The $375-million flight marks the beginning of in-space testing for the capsule. The next test flight is not expected until 2018, however, because of limited NASA budgets, and Orion will not carry astronauts until 2021 at the earliest. But NASA hopes that someday it will take people back to the moon or to Mars.
NASA is also developing a more powerful rocket that would be able to send a fully outfitted Orion out of Earth orbit to the moon or beyond.
Referring to the political debate over funding of NASA’s human space exploration program, Mr. Gerstenmaier said that “a successful test flight just helps that discussion.”
After the delays and postponement on Thursday, flight controllers had been concerned that the launching might be postponed again because of high winds at the launchpad. But the winds stayed below the limit of about 24 miles an hour, and the rocket, with three large boosters fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, ignited right on time and accelerated to supersonic speeds within 85 seconds.
While the capsule did not carry any people, some artifacts were on board, including a sample of lunar soil, part of a dinosaur fossil and a recording of the Mars movement from Gustav Holst’s “The Planets.”
NASA’s rocket systems worked better than some of its computer servers, apparently. NASA TV’s live video feed froze about 10 seconds before the launching, disappointing many viewers. But replays of the launching were available later, and live video of the splashdown, from cameras aboard the capsule and a drone aircraft, was uninterrupted.",1

CHICAGO – Although not ready yet, powerful gene editing tools may one day be used on human embryos, eggs and sperm to remove genes that cause inherited diseases, according to a report by U.S. scientists and ethicists released on Tuesday.
The report from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Academy of Medicine said scientific advances make gene editing in human reproductive cells ""a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.""
The statement signals a softening in approach over the use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9, which has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.
In December 2015, scientists and ethicists at an international meeting held at the NAS in Washington said it would be ""irresponsible"" to use gene editing technology in human embryos for therapeutic purposes, such as to correct genetic diseases, until safety and efficacy issues are resolved.
The latest NAS report now says clinical trials for genome editing of the human germline could be permitted, ""but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.""
CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.
Genome editing is already being planned for use in clinical trials of people to correct diseases caused by a single gene mutation, such as sickle cell disease. But these therapies affect only the patient.
The concern is over the use of the technology in human reproductive cells or early embryos because the changes would be passed along to offspring.
Research using the powerful technique is plowing ahead even as researchers from the University of California and the Broad Institute battle for control over the CRISPR patent.
Although gene editing of human reproductive cells to correct inherited diseases ""must be approached with caution, caution does not mean prohibition,"" the committee said in a statement.",0

Russian cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev and NASA astronaut Steven Swanson blasted off aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket two days ago from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
They had expected to reach the station, a $100 billion research complex that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, six hours later.
But about two hours after launch, the crew’s Soyuz capsule failed to fire its maneuvering engines as planned, forcing a delay to the next station docking opportunity on Thursday.
The cause of the skipped rocket firing remains under investigation, said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias.
Preliminary analysis shows the spaceship was 1 degree out of alignment from its predicted orientation, triggering the Soyuz computers to automatically abort the engine burn, Navias said during a NASA Television broadcast of the docking.
Since Tuesday’s mishap, the Soyuz successfully conducted the necessary engine firings to reach the station.
“Better late than never,” said Navias as the Soyuz made its final approach to the outpost.
The crew’s prolonged journey ended at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) as the Soyuz slipped into a berthing port on the station’s Poisk module.
The arrival of Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson returns the station to a full six-member crew. The orbital outpost, a project of 15 nations, has been short-staffed since two other cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut returned to Earth on March 11.
The 15-nation space station partnership, overseen by the United States and Russia, so far has been immunized from the political and economic fallout following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
Since retiring its fleet of space shuttles in 2011, the United States is dependent on Russia to fly its astronauts to the station, a service that costs NASA more than $63 million per person.
NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, testifying before Congress on Thursday, said it is unlikely Russia will cutoff U.S. access to the station as payback for U.S. sanctions stemming from Russia’s takeover of Crimea.
“Russia is dependent upon the United States to operate the station when it comes to power, when it comes to everyday operation,” Bolden told members of the Space Subcommittee of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.
“Based on my conversations with my Russian counterparts, they are equally worried about terminating activity on the ISS,” Bolden said. (Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",1
18,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/12/02/scientists-debate-risks-ethics-editing-human-dna.html,"Scientists debate risks, ethics of editing human DNA
WASHINGTON – A hot new tool to edit the human genetic code has a big wow factor: the promise of long-sought cures for intractable diseases. But depending on how it's used, that same tool could alter human heredity.
The debate has brought hundreds of scientists and ethicists from 20 countries to a highly unusual, three-day meeting in Washington on the ethics of human gene editing.
""We could be on the cusp of a new era in human history,"" Nobel laureate David Baltimore of the California Institute of Technology said Tuesday in opening the international summit to examine what he called ""deep and disturbing questions.""
""The overriding question is when, if ever, would we want to use gene editing to change human inheritance?"" he said.
That question gained urgency after Chinese researchers made the first attempt at altering genes in human embryos, a laboratory experiment that didn't work well but did raise the prospect of one day modifying genes in a way that goes far beyond helping one sick person — it also could pass those alterations on to future generations.
""That really does raise the issue of, how do we use this technology in a responsible fashion,"" said molecular biologist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, who helped pioneer the most-used gene-editing tool. Her calls for debate on its implications and boundaries led to this week's gathering, a step that could eventually lead to research recommendations.
At issue are tools to precisely edit genes inside living cells, finding specific sections of DNA to slice and repair or replace much like a biological version of cut-and-paste software. There are a few methods but one with the wonky name CRISPR-Cas9 is so fast, cheap and simple for biologists to use that research is booming.
The potential is huge: Scientists are engineering animals with humanlike disorders to unravel the gene defects that fuel them. They're developing treatments for muscular dystrophy, sickle cell disease, cancer and HIV. They're trying to grow transplantable human organs inside pigs. They're even hatching mutant mosquitoes designed to be incapable of spreading malaria, and exploring ways to wipe out invasive species.
One hurdle is safety. While the CRISPR tool is pretty precise, it sometimes cuts the wrong section of DNA. Tuesday, CRISPR pioneer Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard reported Tuesday tweaking the tool's molecular scissors to significantly lower chances of off-target editing errors — an improvement that could have implications both for developing therapies and for germline research.
""The reality is, it will be years until this is turned into some kind of a therapy,"" Doudna cautioned reporters.
Yet many scientists said it's not too early to consider the biggest ethical quandary, that performing what's called germline editing, manipulating reproductive cells — sperm, eggs or embryos — could spread gene changes to future generations.
In the U.S., germline editing for clinical use — meaning for pregnancy — ""is a line that should not be crossed at this time,"" John Holdren of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy said Tuesday.
Last spring's experiment in China highlighted that ethics aside, embryo editing wasn't anywhere near ready for real-world use, because those off-target edits risked fixing one problem only to create another.
But there's controversy over whether and how to continue laboratory experiments to see if it eventually could work. And just as fraudulent stem cell clinics already lure desperate patients, there's worry about misuse of gene-editing techniques before they're proven.
Around the world, laws and guidelines vary widely about what germline, or hereditary, research is allowed. Some ban any research; some allow only lab research but not pregnancies; some have no policies. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health won't fund germline research but private funding is allowed.
What one country attempts ""will have consequences in others,"" the White House's Holdren noted.
It's not just about editing embryos. At the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Kyle Orwig is exploring treatments for male infertility that could alter sperm-producing cells that don't do their job.
Critics note there are other ways to halt transmission of inherited disease. Already, couples undergo in vitro fertilization and have the resulting embryos tested for the family's problem gene before deciding which to have implanted, noted Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society advocacy group.
Allowing gene editing for medical reasons would open the door to designer babies with cosmetic changes, too, she added.
""It would alter future human societies, perhaps profoundly so,"" Darnovsky said Tuesday.
Pre-testing of embryos doesn't solve the problem for all families with devastating rare diseases, said Dr. George Daley of Boston Children's Hospital, recounting families that have dozens of embryos created through IVF to come up with one or two usable ones.
""Is it more ethical to edit embryos, or to screen a lot of embryos and throw them away? I don't know the answer,"" Doudna said.",0

Three researchers involved in creating gene-edited babies were sentenced on Monday as China confirmed a third gene-edited child was also born, according to its state news agency.
Xinhua reported that researchers He Jiankui, Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou were all sentenced for their roles in creating the babies that caused an ethical and international outrage last year.
The existence of the first two children, Lulu and Nana, were announced by He in November 2018 at the International Human Genome Editing Summit, but there was no mention of a third child, until recently.
WORLD'S FIRST GENETICALLY EDITED BABIES? INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE ENSUES AS CHINESE SCIENTIST MAKES BOLD CLAIM
He Jiankui got three years in prison for practicing medicine without a license. He was also fined 3 million yuan ($430,000) by a court in the southern city of Shenzhen for his role in implanting ""genetically-engineered embryos into the females' body,"" Xinhua reported.
""[T]heir acts were 'in the pursuit of personal fame and gain' and have seriously 'disrupted medical order,'"" the state-run news agency added.
Zhang was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1 million yuan ($143,000), Xinhua reported. Qin received an 18-month prison sentence, but with a two-year reprieve, and a 500,000 ($72,000) yuan fine.
The verdict said the three defendants had not obtained qualification as doctors, pursued fame and profits, deliberately violated Chinese regulations on scientific research, and crossed an ethical line in both scientific research and medicine, according to Xinhua. It also said they had fabricated ethical review documents.
Following the November 2018 revelation, there was an enormous global debate over the ethics of what He and the other researchers had done, including the use of a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR. The Chinese government ordered a halt to their work shortly after the announcement. He was reported as missing that December and was fired from the university where the research was conducted.
Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, the college where Jiankui worked, issued a statement, condemning the claim. ""The University was deeply shocked by this event and has taken immediate action to reach Dr. Jiankui He for clarification. Dr. Jiankui He’s previous affiliation, the Department of Biology (hereafter the Department) called an emergency meeting of the Department Academic Committee,"" the university said in a November 2018 statement.
Others called for extensive scrutiny regarding Jiankui's claims, including one of CRISPR's co-inventors, Dr. Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley, who said at the time that the work needed to be verified before it can be substantiated.
“If verified, this work is a break from the cautious and transparent approach of the global scientific community’s application of CRISPR-Cas9 for human germline editing,"" Doudna said in November.
The CRISPR tool has been tested elsewhere in adults to treat diseases, but many in the scientific community denounced He's work as medically unnecessary and unethical, because any genetic changes could be passed down to future generations. The U.S. forbids editing embryos except for lab research.
FUTURISTIC GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGY MAY CAUSE CANCER
He, who is known as “JK,"" told the AP in 2018 that he felt a strong responsibility to make an example, and that society would decide whether to allow the practice to go forward. He disappeared from public view shortly after he announced his research at a conference in Hong Kong 13 months ago, and was apparently detained by authorities, initially in an apartment in Shenzhen, a city in Guangdong province that borders Hong Kong.
It wasn't clear if the three-year prison term includes any of the time he has already spent in custody.

20,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/u-s-russian-crew-blasts-international-space-station-after-strict-n1180101?cid=public-rss_20200409,"MOSCOW — A U.S.-Russian space crew blasted off Thursday to the International Space Station following a tight quarantine amid the coronavirus pandemic.
NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Roscosmos’ Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner lifted off as scheduled at 1:05 p.m. (0805 GMT, 4:05 a.m. EDT) from the Russian-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Their Soyuz MS-16 spacecraft is set to dock at the station six hours later.
Russian space officials have taken extra precautions to protect the crew during training and pre-flight preparations as the coronavirus outbreak has swept the world.
Speaking to journalists Wednesday in a video link from Baikonur, Cassidy said the crew had been in “a very strict quarantine” for the past month and is in good health.
“We all feel fantastic,” he said.
Cassidy pointed out that normally they would be talking to many people at the day-before-launch news conference, but instead were talking to cameras because of the pandemic.
“Obviously, we’d love to have our families here with us, but it’s what we understand we have to do to be safe,” Cassidy said. “The whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.”
Cassidy’s wife, Peggy, had returned to the U.S. from the Russian cosmonaut training center in Star City outside Moscow a few days before the crew left for Baikonur.
Commander Anatoly Ivanishin also noted that extra measures have been taken to keep the crew healthy and safe before launch, adding that none of the crew has had any guests — no family or friends.
“We’ve been completely isolated at this final stage of training,” Ivanishin said.
Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin said earlier this week that nine employees of the state corporation have tested positive for coronavirus. Roscosmos, which controls a sprawling network of production plants and launch facilities, has about 200,000 employees, Rogozin said.
As part of additional precautions, Roscosmos has barred reporters from covering the launch contrary to usual practice.
Ivanishin and Vagner had trained as back-ups for the other two Russians and were picked for the flight only in February after a member of the original Russian crew suffered an eye injury.
As a result, neither have clothes awaiting them at the space station. Ivanishin said that they will be taking some clothes with them on the Soyuz, and the next Russian supply ship will deliver more later.
The mission is the third space flight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and the first for Vagner.
The International Space Station is currently operated by Russian Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, who are due to return to Earth on April 17.",1

The astronaut Peggy Whitson, who early Monday surpassed the 534-day record for most time in space by an American, received a congratulatory call about nine hours later from President Trump and his daughter Ivanka.
President Trump called the International Space Station from the Oval Office, congratulated Dr. Whitson and urged NASA to go further, even saying — perhaps jokingly — that he would like to send an American to Mars “during my first term or at worst during my second term.”
Dr. Whitson had specified that a bill signed by Mr. Trump in March authorizing $19.5 billion in funding for NASA directed the agency to send astronauts to the planet during the 2030s. But the president, undeterred, said later in the call that such a mission could take place “a lot sooner than we’re even thinking.”
At 1:27 a.m. Eastern, Dr. Whitson, 57, surpassed a record previously held by the astronaut Jeff Williams, who spent 534 cumulative days in space. Her current mission launched in November, and though it originally was scheduled to return home in June, it is now scheduled to last until September.
In addition to Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter and an adviser in the West Wing, Mr. Trump was joined on the call by the astronaut Kate Rubins. Aboard the space station, Dr. Whitson stood with Col. Jack Fischer, an astronaut who arrived there last week.
“It’s actually a huge honor to break a record like this,” Dr. Whitson told the president. “It’s an honor for me basically to be representing all the folks at NASA who make this spaceflight possible and who make me setting this record feasible.”
Ms. Trump appeared to be on the line to emphasize that Dr. Whitson, a biochemist, and Dr. Rubins, a biologist who studies cancer, were women who had excelled in math and science.
Mr. Trump asked several questions about the experiments being conducted on the station, which Colonel Fischer called “by far the best example of international cooperation and what we can do when we work together, in the history of humanity.”
Mr. Trump said of the astronauts: “You know, I’ve been dealing with politicians so much; I’m so much more impressed with these people. You have no idea.”
At one point, responding to a question about what the astronauts were learning in space, Dr. Whitson explained that water was a particularly precious resource on the station.
“We also are cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable, and it’s really not as bad as it sounds,” she said, eliciting a smirk from Mr. Trump.
“Well that’s good, I’m glad to hear that,” he responded after a moment. “Better you than me.”
He also asked questions about American entrepreneurship in space and mentioned the potential military application of the work being done on the station.
In March, Dr. Whitson broke another record, for most spacewalks by a female astronaut. She is also the first woman to have commanded the space station twice.
NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, congratulated Dr. Whitson in a statement released before the call, which was streamed on the space agency’s site and on YouTube.
“This is an inspirational record Peggy is setting today,” he said. “And she would be the first to tell you this is a record that’s absolutely made to be broken as we advance our knowledge and existence as both Americans and humans.”
Dr. Whitson, who uses the handle AstroPeggy on her social media accounts, including Twitter and Tumblr, is an Iowa native with a doctorate in biochemistry from Rice University. She joined NASA in 1989 and was selected as a candidate to be an astronaut seven years later. Her first space mission was conducted in 2002.
During the call, answering a question from Ms. Trump, she said that the Apollo program had originally inspired her to be an astronaut, but that it had not been a goal until around the time the first female astronauts were selected.
“It took me a lot longer to become an astronaut than I ever really wanted it to take,” she said. “But I do think I’m better at my job because of the journey.”",1
22,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-china-babies-genes-letter/more-than-100-scientists-in-china-say-baby-gene-editing-is-crazy-idUSKCN1NW0A7?feedType=RSS&feedName;=scienceNews,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese officials and scientists denounced on Tuesday the claims of a geneticist who said he had created the first gene-edited babies, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
More than 100 scientists said in an open letter the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in China.
In videos posted online, scientist He Jiankui defended what he said he had achieved - embryonic gene editing to help protect twin baby girls born this month from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
“Pandora’s box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before it’s too late,” the scientists said in their letter, a copy of which was posted by the Chinese news website the Paper.
“The biomedical ethics review for this so-called research exists in name only. Conducting direct human experiments can only be described as crazy,” the approximately 120 scientists said in the Chinese-language letter.
Yang Zhengang, a Fudan University professor, told Reuters he signed the letter because gene editing was “very dangerous”.
China’s Genetics Society and the Chinese Society for Stem Cell Research said in a statement He had acted as an “individual” and his work posed “tremendous safety risks for the research subjects”.
“We believe the research led by He is strongly against both the Chinese regulations and the consensus reached by the international science community,” the two groups said in a statement posted online.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut-and-paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are also concerns about its safety and ethics.
(Graphic explaining the Crispr DNA editing technique, tmsnrt.rs/2ReKG1R)
He, who is due to speak at a summit on human genome editing at the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Shenzhen Harmonicare Hospital, listed on China’s online clinical trial registry as having given ethical approval for He’s experiment, denied having ever taken part in any clinical operations relating to “gene-edited babies”.
The signatures on the online form were suspected of having been forged and “no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”, Hong Kong-listed Harmonicare Medical Holdings said in a statement.
‘VERY SHOCKED’
The Southern University of Science and Technology, where He holds an associate professorship, also said it had been unaware of the research project and that He had been on leave without pay since February.
The Shenzhen City Science and Innovation Committee, a municipal fund which was also listed on the clinical trial registry as having backed the trial, said in a statement on Monday it had never been involved in the project.
Xu Nanping, vice minister of China’s science and technology ministry, told reporters he was “very shocked” on hearing He’s claim, adding that such work had been prohibited since 2003.
Details of the case were still unclear, Xu said.
“We don’t know if this work is real or fake. If it’s real, then this is certainly banned in China.”
The official Xinhua news agency said ethics could not be ignored.
“Scientific exploration is never-ending ... but this does not mean that the morals of science can be abandoned or that ethical standards can be ignored,” the news agency said in a comment posted on social media.
The National Health Commission said on Monday it was “highly concerned” and had ordered provincial health officials “to immediately investigate and clarify the matter”.
The government’s medical ethics committee in Shenzhen said it was investigating the case, as was the Guangdong provincial health commission, according to Southern Metropolis Daily, a state media outlet.
The committee organizing the Hong Kong conference where He is due to speak - the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing - said in a statement on Monday it had only just been informed of He’s work on the genes of the twin girls.
“Our goal is to help ensure that human genome editing research be pursued responsibly,” the committee said.

23,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/nasa-logo-worm-spacex.html,"NASA’s ‘Worm’ Logo Will Return to Space
The new old logo, dropped in the 1990s in favor of a more vintage brand, will adorn a SpaceX rocket that is to carry astronauts to the space station in May.
It was designed for NASA in the 1970s, and it hasn’t been back to space since the 1990s. But in 2020, it will head to orbit once more.
We’re talking about “the worm.”
It’s a logo that a generation grew up with — a minimalist twisting of red letters that is nicknamed after terrestrial invertebrates. NASA used it from 1975, when it was introduced as part of a cleaner visual redesign for the space agency, to 1992, when it was kicked to the side.
But the familiar yet long unused modern symbol will be seen on the side of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket when two NASA astronauts, Douglas G. Hurley and Robert L. Behnken, head to the International Space Station, a mission scheduled for the second half of May. They will be the first to launch to orbit from American soil since 2011, and the new old logo was dusted off to commemorate the milestone.
In 1992, Daniel S. Goldin, then NASA’s administrator, decided that the best way to excite people about the future was to harken to the agency’s heady early days. He resurrected an earlier insignia with a different nickname — “the meatball.”
The meatball — a blue circle filled with stars, a red swoosh that represents an airplane wing and a spacecraft orbiting the wing — was NASA’s logo during the agency’s greatest accomplishments, including the Apollo moon landings, and NASA has used it for the last 28 years.
The worm, however, was not forgotten, especially among members of Generation X such as Jim Bridenstine, the current NASA administrator. Mr. Bridenstine often points out that he is the first administrator to be born after the end of the Apollo program.
“I grew up in the ’80s,” Mr. Bridenstine said in an interview. “In the ’80s, the worm logo was the logo of NASA. I’ve always been kind of partial to it.”
Five years ago, two graphic designers, Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth, republished an official 1976 document, the “National Aeronautics and Space Administration Graphics Standards Manual,” which prescribed how the new logo should be used. The reissue is now in its fifth printing, with more than 30,000 copies sold.
“We had said among ourselves, ‘How cool would it be if it actually came back one day?’” Mr. Smyth said. “It was kind of the fantasy. We never seriously thought it would happen.”
Since 2017, use of the worm logo has been permitted on T-shirts and other souvenirs sold all over the world.
“We’ve just seen it come to rise in popular culture, in fashion in particular,” Mr. Reed said.
Since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011, American astronauts have relied on Russia and its Soyuz rockets for transportation to orbit. But as SpaceX was getting close to the first launch of its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule with astronauts aboard, Mr. Bridenstine thought, “It would be a fitting tribute to that moment to bring back the worm as an inspiration to the nation.”
The announcement of the worm revival was initially scheduled to go out April 1 when it might have been mistaken as an April Fool’s joke. It was pushed back a day.
“What they were trying to represent in the ’70s was cutting-edge technology,” Mr. Smyth said. “They got it so right that it still looks like cutting-edge technology even though it’s close to 40 years later.”
By coincidence, April 2 is the birthday of Richard Danne, the designer who directed the 1970s graphics reinvention.
“I was thrilled to see the announcement, especially since it arrived on my 86th birthday!” Mr. Danne wrote via email. “What a marvelous present here.”
It was not a complete surprise. About a month ago, designers from SpaceX reached out to Mr. Reed and Mr. Smyth to find out the correct shade of red they should be using. The men put SpaceX in touch with Mr. Danne.
“Naturally I started putting two and two together,” Mr. Danne said.
In the manual, the color was defined as simply “NASA Red.” Today, there is a universal color matching system defined by the Pantone company, and NASA Red is Pantone color number 179.
For now, the worm will appear just on the one SpaceX rocket, and NASA is keeping the meatball as its primary icon. But Mr. Bridenstine said the worm could find a wider role at NASA. “We’re kind of working through it right now,” he said.
Mr. Bridenstine said he could imagine that a second spacecraft for taking NASA astronauts to the space station, the Starliner built by Boeing, might also sport the worm logo. “We haven’t gotten that far yet,” he said. “But I imagine when the Starliner launches, it would likely have the worm as well.”
But the Starliner will not have its first crewed flight for a while. After a flawed test flight without astronauts in December, Boeing will repeat the uncrewed mission before launching astronauts, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The company later acknowledged the decision.
Regardless of how NASA decides to mix and match two very different designs, fans of the worm are ecstatic that a beloved icon that had been tossed into the dust bins of graphic design indeed has a future.
“I’m just over the moon that they did this,” Mr. Smyth said.",1
24,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/oldest-woman-in-space-blasts-off-again-for-third-iss-mission,"A multinational crew including a US astronaut who is the oldest and most experienced woman to fly in space blasted off from Kazakhstan for a two-day journey to the International Space Station.
The Russian Soyuz rocket carrying American Peggy Whitson, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday night local time.
Whitson, 56, a biochemist and Nasa’s former chief astronaut, is making her third trip to the station.
By the time she returns to Earth in six months she will have accumulated more time in orbit than any other US astronaut, surpassing the 534-day record set in September by astronaut Jeff Williams.
“The most important thing about the station is the friendships and the work we accomplish there,” Whitson said during a prelaunch news conference on Wednesday in Kazakhstan.
Novitskiy, 45, who is making his second spaceflight, added: “The station is ... a place where we can demonstrate to the entire world that you can have normal relations, where you can work without being distracted by things that don’t really matter.”
Pesquet, 38, is a rookie astronaut representing the European Space Agency.
The crew are due to reach the station on Saturday, where they will be greeted by Nasa astronaut Shane Kimbrough and Russian flight engineers Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko, who arrived on 21 October.
The combined crew will be one of the last six-member teams to live on the station for a while. Beginning in March, Russia plans to cut the number of cosmonauts serving on the station to two from three, following delays in launching a new science laboratory. The Multipurpose Laboratory Module is now expected to be launched in 2018.",1
25,https://apnews.com/19c395ef2d3148b1a8ae0ab8be5375b0,"China says doctor behind gene-edited babies acted on his own
BEIJING (AP) — Chinese investigators have determined that the doctor behind the reported birth of two babies whose genes had been edited in hopes of making them resistant to the AIDS virus acted on his own and will be punished for any violations of the law, a state media report said Monday.
Investigators in the southern province of Guangdong determined Dr. He Jiankui organized and handled funding for the experiment without outside assistance in violation of national guidelines, the Xinhua News Agency said.
Along with the birth of the twins, another embryo yet to be born reportedly resulted from He’s experiment. All three will remain under medical observation with regular visits supervised by government health departments, Xinhua said.
It didn’t say which laws He might have violated but said he had fabricated an ethical review by others.
“This behavior seriously violates ethics and the integrity of scientific research, is in serious violation of relevant national regulations and creates a pernicious influence at home and abroad,” the report said.
Then little-known, He attended an elite meeting in Berkeley, California, in 2017 where scientists and ethicists were discussing a technology that had shaken the field to its core — an emerging tool for “editing” genes, the strings of DNA that form the blueprint of life.
He embraced the tool, called CRISPR, and last year rocked an international conference with the claim that he had helped make the world’s first gene-edited babies , despite a clear scientific consensus that making genetic changes that could be passed to future generations should not be attempted at this point.
China called an immediate halt to He’s experiments following his announcement.
Gene editing for reproductive purposes is effectively banned in the U.S. and most of Europe. In China, ministerial guidelines prohibit embryo research that “violates ethical or moral principles.”
The chief of the World Health Organization said last year his agency is assembling experts to consider the health impact of gene editing.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said gene editing “cannot be just done without clear guidelines” and experts should “start from a clean sheet and check everything.”
“We have a big part of our population who say, ‘Don’t touch,’” Tedros told reporters. “We have to be very, very careful, and the working group will do that.”",0
26,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/26/chinese-scientist-creates-worlds-first-genetically-edited-babies/,"A Chinese researcher claims he helped make the world's first genetically edited babies - twin girls whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.
If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.
A US scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.
Many mainstream scientists think it's too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.
The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have - an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the Aids virus.
He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.
There is no independent confirmation of He's claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it on Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organisers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin on Tuesday, and earlier in interviews with The Associated Press.
""I feel a strong responsibility that it's not just to make a first, but also make it an example,"" He said. ""Society will decide what to do next"" in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.
Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.
It's ""unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,"" said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.
""This is far too premature,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. ""We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal.""
However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University's George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called ""a major and growing public health threat.""
""I think this is justifiable,"" Church said of that goal.
In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that's causing problems.
It's only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different - the changes can be inherited. In the US, it's not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.
He Jiankui, who goes by ""JK,"" studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the US before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.
The US scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called ""a small stake"" in - and is on the scientific advisory boards of - He's two companies.
The Chinese researcher said he practised editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.
He said he chose to try embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.
All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.
Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.
He recruited couples through a Beijing-based Aids advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym ""Bai Hua,"" said it's not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.
He describes the work
The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was ""washed"" to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.
When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.
Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.
Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.
They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.
""It's almost like not editing at all"" if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.
Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.
""In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you're exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,"" Musunuru said.
The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers' ""main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,"" Church said.
Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it's very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.
There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it - on November 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.
It's unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an ""AIDS vaccine development"" programme.
The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he ""absolutely"" thinks they were able to understand the risks.
Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.
""That might be a layman's way of describing it,"" he said.
Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.
The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical followup until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they're adults.
Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analysed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a ""first"" was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.
He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.
Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants' HIV infection from being disclosed.
""We think this is ethical,"" said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.
Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He's lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.
The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but ""are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it's their life on the line.""
""I believe this is going to help the families and their children,"" He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, ""I would feel the same pain as they do and it's going to be my own responsibility.""",0
27,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-station-crew-idUSKBN17M0R4,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A two-man U.S.-Russian crew floated into the International Space Station on Thursday, hours after blasting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, a NASA TV broadcast showed.
A Russian Soyuz capsule carrying U.S. astronaut Jack Fischer, 43, and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, 58, lifted off at 1:13 p.m. local time/3:13 a.m. EDT (0713 GMT) with a rare empty third seat. Russia is scaling back space station staffing until its long-delayed science laboratory is flown to the orbiting outpost next year.
Fischer and Yurchikhin reached the $100 billion space station, which orbits about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth on schedule at 9:18 a.m. EDT (1318 GMT). About two hours later, hatches between the Soyuz capsule and station opened.
Fischer, on his first space voyage, and Yurchikhin floated into the waiting arms of station commander Peggy Whitson and her crew. Their first order of business was a congratulatory phone call from family and friends at the Russian mission control center outside of Moscow.
“It’s so beautiful,” Fischer told his wife, describing the experience as “a burrito of awesomeness smothered in awesome sauce.”
Fischer also had some comforting words for his mother.
“Mom, it’s like me being in Texas, depending on where we are going around the Earth, I’ll be just as close,” he said. “I can still call you. So no need to miss me.”
Prior to launch, the rookie flier said he thought his biggest challenge would be learning how to use the station’s zero-gravity toilet, a difficult task that relies on suction.
Fisher, with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is sharing the station with two seasoned veterans, a Russian cosmonaut on his second flight and a first-time French flier.
Soyuz crewmate Yurchikhin has made four previous space flights. Commander Whitson, 57, in the midst of her third long-duration mission, is due on Monday to beat the 534-day record for cumulative time spent in space by a U.S. astronaut.
She is expected to receive a congratulatory phone call on Monday from U.S. President Donald Trump, NASA said on Wednesday.
Whitson, who flew to the station in November along with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, will remain aboard with Fischer and Yurchikhin until September.

28,https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/twin-astronaut-study-suggests-interplanetary-travel-may-not-be-a-health-risk/,"The human body “remains robust and resilient” after almost a year in space, according to a long-term, multi-institutional study of twins, one of whom lived aboard the International Space Station for 340 days while the other remained on Earth. These heartening results remove a potential barrier to crewed interplanetary missions — and just in time for us to start planning them.
The study, conducted by NASA and its partners on the American astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly, minutely monitored the twins vitals to see what if any changes occurred to the twin in orbit (Scott) that didn’t to the twin below (Mark). And changes there were, but nothing worrying enough that souls brave enough to go to space will second-guess their profession.
“We have only scratched the surface of knowledge about the body in space,” explained Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of NASA’s Human Research Program. “The Twins Study gave us the first integrated molecular view into genetic changes, and demonstrated how a human body adapts and remains robust and resilient even after spending nearly a year aboard the International Space Station. The data captured from integrated investigations like the NASA Twins Study will be explored for years to come.”
There have been previous studies that showed how microgravity and other factors lead to, for example, lower bone density, and consequently the need to address those specific trends with changes to diet or habits. But this is by far the longest anyone has had their health monitored in space, and having a twin on the ground to use as a control body makes for incredibly powerful — yet still limited — results. (Here it seems only fair to note that Mark Kelly is also an accomplished veteran astronaut, not just a “control body.”)
Some expected occurrences included weight loss, lower blood pressure, and eyesight problems due to the lack of gravity. But the length and nature of the study also allowed for several interesting new phenomena in the immunological and molecular domains to be considered. There’s good news and bad news.
Telomeres are parts of our chromosomes that help with, among other things, maintaining our genes. They were immediately affected by presence in space and genetic variation six times that of the control was observed. They lengthened considerably, then upon return to Earth were much shorter than normal. What causes this and what effects it could have are unknown.
That genetic variation also returned to normal when returning to the surface — for the most part. But about 7 percent, many relating to immune response and DNA repair, didn’t. Is there a reason for those genes being affected? It’s impossible to say with a sample size of one. It’s also important to note that these genes weren’t necessarily “damaged” or anything, but that their expression levels had changed. The DNA itself remained intact.
Fortunately, the immune system itself functioned perfectly during and after Scott’s time in space. That’s hugely important, as a weakened immune system could be hugely troublesome on a long, isolated trip to another planet where no additional medical aid can be provided.
The genetic damage may be slightly worrying, but honestly if that’s the biggest issue emerging out of someone spending a year in a can floating through space, it’s seriously good news. The brain (the most critical part of an astronaut) worked great — the circulatory system adapted well — muscles and bones stayed in great shape. Potential telomeric damage and genetic variation aren’t fun, but they aren’t showstoppers either and may very well be preventable.
Considering expeditions to the planned lunar base would almost certainly be longer in duration than those to the ISS, this is great news for the blooming extra-orbital space community. And missions to Mars, as difficult as they may be otherwise, will not have to contend with immune systems shutting down or brain damage from blood pressure changes. That kind of confidence goes a long way.
This study is only the first of many, to be sure, and in fact the teams warn that, because they only had the one person in space as an experimental group, “it is impossible to attribute causality to spaceflight versus a coincidental event. Therefore, our study should be considered as hypothesis-generating and framework-defining and must be complemented in the future by studies of additional astronauts.”
Expect more studies both of this data and whatever gets gathered from future missions to test and verify the results published today. You can read the full paper in the journal Science, and hear much more about the setup and the twins themselves at NASA’s Twins Study page.",1

Designer babies or an end to intractable illnesses: A revolutionary technology is letting scientists learn to rewrite the genetic code, aiming to alter DNA in ways that, among other things, could erase disease-causing genes.
How far should these experiments try to go - fix only the sick, or make changes that future generations could inherit?
Hundreds of scientists and ethicists from around the world gather in Washington this week to debate the boundaries of human genome editing, sort of a biological cut-and-paste tool that allows researchers to spot a gene defect inside living cells and swap it out.
It's all experimental so far, but the promise for new treatments is huge. The ethical quandary: Should it also be attempted in human embryos, altering a gene in not just one person but his or her descendants? Already, China has reported the first laboratory experiment with embryos to start learning how.
""This is really a decision that will affect us all,"" said Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society advocacy group, who opposes heritable gene editing. She called it potentially a ""society-altering technology.""
But pioneer Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, warns that a ban on even basic gene editing research in embryos could block important discoveries. Writing in the journal Nature, she urged scientists to find ""an appropriate middle ground.""
Here's a look at the science and the controversy, on the eve of the international summit hosted by the U.S. National Academies of Science and Medicine.
----
WHAT IS GENE EDITING
While scientists have long been able to find defective genes, fixing them has been so cumbersome that it's slowed development of genetic therapies. With gene editing, scientists home in on a piece of DNA and use molecular tools that act as scissors to snip that spot - deleting a defective gene, repairing it or replacing it.
There are some older methods but a new tool called CRISPR-Cas9 has been adopted by laboratories worldwide because it's faster, cheaper, simple enough to use with minimal training, and allows altering of multiple genes simultaneously.
----
WHAT IT MIGHT TREAT
The biggest use so far is to rapidly engineer animals with human-like disorders for basic research, but promising gene-editing experiments make regular headlines.
Much like a bone marrow transplant, researchers hope to use CRISPR for diseases like sickle cell, correcting the faulty gene in someone's own blood-producing cells rather than implanting donated ones.
Similarly, doctors in Britain recently treated a 1-year-old with leukemia using donated immune cells that had been experimentally altered with an older editing method to target her cancer. A California company is testing a non-CRISPR way to make HIV patients' immune cells better resist the virus.
The University of Massachusetts just reported using a CRISPR technique to switch off, rather than cut and repair, a gene in muscle cells that causes one form of muscular dystrophy.
And Harvard researchers recently edited 62 spots in pig DNA, part of work to use the animals to grow organs for human transplant.
----
THE BIGGEST HURDLE
Safety is a key question because gene editing isn't always precise enough; there's the possibility of accidentally cutting DNA that's similar to the real target. Out-of-body treatments like altering blood cells get around the fear of fixing one problem only to spark another, and efforts to improve precision are under way.
----
THE ETHICS CONTROVERSY
Altering genes in sperm, eggs or embryos can spread those changes to future generations, so-called germline engineering that might one day stop parents from passing inherited diseases to their children.
Chinese scientists reported the first-known attempt to edit human embryos last spring, working with leftovers from fertility clinics that never could have developed into fetuses. They aimed to correct a deadly inherited gene, but uncovered problems that will require more research.
Germline engineering ""has been viewed almost universally as a line that should not be crossed,"" National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said at the time.
After all, future generations couldn't consent, and any long-term negative effects might not become apparent for years. There's also concern about babies designed for better intellect, athleticism or appearance rather than to prevent disease.
There's wide agreement that the technique isn't safe enough yet to attempt a pregnancy with an altered embryo. But there are other kinds of germline research. In Britain, for example, researchers have requested permission to gene-edit human embryos in the lab, studying early development in ways that might shed light on miscarriage.
----
IS IT LEGAL
Where you live determines if, or what kind of, research can be performed on embryos. Some countries, especially in Europe, ban germline research. Others, such as China, have guidelines described as unenforceable. Britain allows basic lab research only.
In the U.S., the NIH won't fund research involving germline editing but private funding is allowed.
----
BEYOND MEDICINE
Human gene editing aside, there are environmental concerns, too. Experiments are under way to force genetic changes to spread rapidly through populations of animals and plants - changes that could wipe out invasive species or disease-carrying insects. A California team reported a first step last week, hatching malaria-resistant mosquitoes that could easily spread their new protective gene to their offspring.",0

Chinese scientist He Jiankui shocked the scientific community after revealing that he had successfully altered the DNA of twin girls born in November to prevent them from contracting HIV.
State media reported on Monday that a preliminary investigation confirmed that a second woman became pregnant and that she will be put under medical observation, but no other details about her are known.
Professor He, who now faces a police investigation, had mentioned the potential second pregnancy at a human genome conference in Hong Kong in late November, but its status was unclear until now.
William Hurlbut, a physician and bioethicist at Stanford university in California who has known He for two years, told AFP it was ""too early"" at the time for the foetus to appear on an ultrasound.
Based on extensive conversations with He, Hurlbut said: ""I get the impression the baby was fairly young when the conference happened. It could only be detected chemically, not clinically (at the time).
""So it could be no more than four to six weeks old (at the time), so now it could be about 12 to 14 weeks.""
Hurlbut said he had planned to visit He's lab following the genome summit. They had seen each other several times over the past two years.
But after news of his experiment was published, He was placed ""under protection of security people"" and the two never saw each other in person, he said.
They exchanged emails and spoke on the phone every week after that, but Hurlbut last heard from He seven days ago.
He has been residing in an apartment at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in the city of Shenzhen, where his family has been allowed to visit him in the day time, Hurlbut said.
""He doesn't sound like a person under terrible fear or stress."" said Hurlbut.
""He said he was free to go out on to the campus and walk around.""
But He could be facing legal trouble.
A probe by the Guangdong provincial government found that He had ""forged ethical review papers"" and ""deliberately evaded supervision"", according to state-run Xinhua news agency.
He had ""privately"" organised a project team that included foreign staff, it said.
He will be ""dealt with seriously according to the law,"" and his case will be ""handed over to public security organs for handling"", Xinhua said.

32,http://www.france24.com/en/20170920-genome-editing-reveals-key-gene-human-embryo-growth,"British scientists have used genome ""editing"" technology to reveal the role of a key gene in the early development of human embryos, a potential boost for fertility treatment.
They used genome ""scissors"" called CRISPR-Cas9 to snip out a gene called OCT4 from fertilised eggs.
OCT4 is thought to be a major player in embryo formation.
""After the egg is fertilised, it divides until at about seven days it forms a ball of around 200 cells called the 'blastocyst',"" authors of the study explained in a press release on Wednesday.
""The study found that human embryos need OCT4 to correctly form a blastocyst.""
This was the first use of genome editing to study gene function in human embryos, which could help scientists to better understand early development, said the Francis Crick Institute, whose researchers took part in the study.
""This proof of principle lays out a framework for future investigations that could transform our understanding of human biology,"" said the study published in the science journal Nature.
The work boosts the quest for therapeutic use of stem cells and in IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) treatments,"" it said.
On a technical level, the study confirmed CRISPR-Cas9 editing as a ""powerful method"" for probing the role of individual genes in human development.
The technique -- repeatedly mooted as a worthy candidate for a Nobel -- allows scientists to remove and replace a faulty sequence on a strand of DNA with pinpoint precision.
The method can theoretically be used to eliminate disease-bearing mutations in embryos, or to engineer more nutritious and resilient plants and healthier livestock.
It is controversial because, say critics, it evokes a future in which humans can order ""designer"" babies with specific features, perhaps even intelligence.
""One way to find out what a gene does in the developing embryo is to see what happens when it isn?t working. Now we have demonstrated an efficient way of doing this,"" said Kathy Niakan, one of the Francis Crick Institute authors.
""If we knew the key genes that embryos need to develop successfully, we could improve IVF treatments and understand some causes of pregnancy failure. It may take many years to achieve such an understanding, our study is just the first step.""
The embryos used in the study were donated by couples who had undergone IVF treatment for infertility.
Other experts welcomed the study findings.
""This landmark study confirms CRISPR?s status as a transformative tool for research,"" said Andrew Chisholm of the Wellcome research trust.
""This work underscores why such studies are key to understanding our own biology.""
In August, scientists in the United States said they had repaired a disease-causing mutation in the DNA of early-stage human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 -- although other teams have expressed doubts about their conclusions.

She already holds the record for most time in space for a woman: nearly 400 days during her various missions. By the time she returns next spring, she should break the record for any American, man or woman.
“We could not be more proud,” NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Whitson once she entered the space station. He joined the new crew’s family and friends at Russia’s Mission Control outside Moscow to welcome the newcomers on board.
“I’m really happy to be here,” Whitson replied.
A biochemist by training, Whitson will celebrate her 57th birthday at the orbiting lab in February. Until Thursday, no woman older than 55 had flown in space.

The statement on Thursday comes amid a growing debate over the use of powerful new gene editing tools in human eggs, sperm and embryos, which have the power to change the DNA of unborn children.
The group’s guidance follows calls for various bans on use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9, which has quickly become the preferred method of gene editing in research labs because of its ease of use compared with older techniques.
CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.

The crew will be the first to travel to orbit from American soil since the space shuttle stopped flying in 2011.
[When to watch SpaceX’s next NASA launch of astronauts.]
NASA announced on Friday that it has set May 27 as the target launch date for sending two astronauts to the International Space Station from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, aboard a rocket built by the company SpaceX.
Jim Bridenstine, administrator of the space agency, made the announcement on Twitter.
BREAKING: On May 27, @NASA will once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil!

Let's #LaunchAmerica 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/RINb3mfRWI— Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) April 17, 2020
That would end a drought of nearly nine years since the last time people headed to orbit from American soil. On July 8, 2011, the space shuttle Atlantis lifted off from Launchpad 39A; it returned to Earth 11 days later. Since then, NASA has relied on Russia and its Soyuz rockets for transportation to and from the space station.
This time, the launch will again occur at 39A, at 4:32 p.m. on May 27, but almost everything else will be different. Instead of designing and operating its own spaceship as it did for the space shuttles and earlier programs like the Apollo moon landings, NASA has turned to two commercial companies: SpaceX and Boeing.
The first crewed mission is a final step for SpaceX to verify that its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule meet NASA’s requirements. SpaceX conducted a successful demonstration flight — without astronauts aboard — in March last year, but then ran into further obstacles and delays.
In January, SpaceX conducted another critical test, launching the capsule without anyone aboard and deliberately destroying the rocket to show that the escape system was capable of whisking astronauts to safety in case of an emergency.
May’s flight will carry two NASA astronauts: Douglas G. Hurley and Robert L. Behnken. Both have been to space before on space shuttle missions, and Mr. Hurley was the pilot on the last Atlantis mission.
Although NASA has greatly cut back on work at its centers during the coronavirus outbreak — most of its employees are working at home, even for tasks such as directing the Curiosity rover on Mars — the SpaceX flight is regarded as essential work. Florida’s Brevard county, home to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, has not been among the hardest hit areas so far, reporting 192 cases and six deaths through Friday afternoon.
Currently there are only three astronauts aboard the International Space Station — two Russians, Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, and one NASA astronaut, Christopher J. Cassidy.
Three others — Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan of NASA and Oleg Skripochka of Russia — returned to Earth safely on Friday morning.
With the smaller crew, scientific work will be curtailed; the remaining crew will spend much of its time maintaining the space station.
The stay of Mr. Hurley and Mr. Behnken at the space station was scheduled to last just two weeks. That may now be extended. In February, Mr. Hurley reported that he was being trained to conduct spacewalks and operate the robotics systems on the space station.
For now, NASA states, “The specific duration of the mission is to be determined.”
If SpaceX’s demonstration mission succeeds, it would be followed by what NASA calls its first operational mission for the Crew Dragon. That flight would take four astronauts — three from NASA and one from the Japanese space agency — to the space station.
Boeing may not be able to get astronauts aboard its spacecraft, called Starliner, until next year. A crewless test mission in December encountered problems shortly after launch when the Starliner failed to fire its thrusters on time to place it in the proper orbit. By the time controllers on the ground corrected the problem, the spacecraft had wasted too much propellant to allow it to dock at the space station.
As engineers diagnosed the issue, they discovered a second error with the spacecraft’s software that could have been led to Starliner’s demise as it prepared for re-entry. They fixed that, and the capsule returned to Earth safely.
A subsequent investigation revealed lapses in Boeing’s software development and testing procedures, and the company will now repeat its uncrewed test flight later this year before moving on to a flight with astronauts aboard.

“Although many of the objectives of Boeing’s first uncrewed flight test in December 2019 were accomplished, Boeing decided the best approach to meeting the agency’s requirements would be to fly the mission again, including docking with the space station,” said NASA in a blog post. “Data from the next and previous flight test will be used as part of NASA’s process of certifying Boeing’s crew transportation system for carrying astronauts to and from the space station.”

39,https://www.france24.com/en/20190411-nasas-twins-study-landmark-research-eventual-mars-mission,"A NASA study of a US astronaut who spent a year in space while his twin brother remained on Earth is providing valuable insights into the effects of extended spaceflight on the human body, a key to planning a future manned mission to Mars, researchers said Thursday.
US astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year on the International Space Station while his identical twin Mark Kelly, also a former NASA astronaut, stayed on the ground.
The researchers who carried out the ""NASA Twins Study"" found that most of the changes to Scott's body during his time in space returned to normal within months of his return to Earth -- although not all of them.
The findings, published in the journal Science, were encouraging to scientists and engineers envisioning interplanetary travel such as an eventual trip to Mars, a mission that could last two to three years.
""The Twins Study is the most comprehensive review of the response of the human body to spaceflight ever conducted,"" said Dr Susan Bailey of Colorado State University.
Dr Steven Platts, deputy chief scientist of NASA's Human Research Program, said it will ""guide future biomedical space research and allow us to have a safer journey to and from Mars.""
Using Mark as a baseline, 84 researchers at 12 universities documented the molecular, cognitive and physiological effects of Scott's year in space.
Scott, a 50-year-old veteran of two US Space Shuttle missions, spent 340 consecutive days on the ISS -- from March 27, 2015 to March 1, 2016.
He was monitored pre-flight and post-flight and during his time on the ISS. Blood, urine and stool samples were sent back to Earth on resupply vessels.
At the same time, scientists monitored Mark -- a veteran himself of four Space Shuttle missions -- on Earth as what they called a ""genetically matched ground control.""
- 'Nauseous, dizzy' -
Bailey said the uniqueness of using twins was because the scientists could ""attribute any kind of differences that we saw in spaceflight to spaceflight.
""It wasn't because of any genetic differences,"" she said.
Dr Michael Snyder of Stanford University said there are ""thousands of gene and molecular changes that occur as someone goes in space.""
""Virtually all of those returned to normal (in Scott) by six months,"" Snyder said. ""It's reassuring to know that when you come back things will largely be back to the same.""
Scott Kelly said he was extremely fatigued after coming back from the ISS and attributed it mostly to the adaptation to gravity.
""I felt like I had the flu,"" he said.
""I was nauseous. I was dizzy,"" he said, and suffered from joint and muscle pain and rashes.
Dr Stuart Lee of NASA's Johnson Space Center said measurements were taken of the thickness in both Scott and Mark of the carotid artery wall, which can be a predictor of cardiovascular disease or stroke risk.
""Our main findings in Scott were that the carotid artery wall became thicker early in flight and remained so throughout the mission,"" Lee said.
Mark did not have any such thickening.
Thickening of the carotid artery wall has been observed in astronauts previously.
So has weight loss due to poorer nutrition in space and a lack of exercise.
Scott lost seven percent of his body mass during his time on the ISS while Mark gained about four percent during the course of the study.
In one test, both Scott and Mark were administered a flu vaccination. It delivered a similar immune response.
The twins also performed a battery of cognitive tests before, during and after the flight and found that Scott's cognitive performance declined post-flight in terms of speed and accuracy.
- Telomere length -
Chris Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine, looked at how the unique environment of space impacts genes.
""We catalogued basically what is the landscape of all these genes that have gone up and gone down at different stages during the mission,"" Mason said.
""We saw that the vast majority, over 90 percent of all these changes, all returned back to baseline coming back to Earth,"" Mason said.
Some of the most interesting research was done by Bailey's team at Colorado State University which looked at telomeres, the ends of chromosomes that typically shorten as people get older.
Telomeres are considered a biomarker of aging or health risks from cardiovascular disease or cancer.
Bailey's team evaluated Scott and Mark's telomere lengths before the flight and found that they were very similar.
What surprised her team was that Scott experienced a ""specific elongation of telomeres"" during his time on the ISS.
Bailey cautioned that the finding ""can't really be viewed as the fountain of youth and that people might expect to live longer because they're in space.""
She said there was a ""very rapid decrease"" in telomere length upon Scott's return to Earth and he also experienced some unexplained telomere loss.
Bailey said her team has not come up with a reason for the telomere lengthening but was looking at whether the higher radiation exposure in space, inflammation or stress may be responsible.

40,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-gene-editing-idUSL1N13P16Q20151130,"CHICAGO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A group of U.S. scientists and activists on Monday called for a global ban on the use of new tools to edit the genes of human embryos, in a report issued a day before a major international meeting in Washington to discuss the ethical and policy issues surrounding the technology.
A technological innovation that can strategically edit out specific stretches of DNA could ultimately lead to the genetic modification of children, and should be halted before it starts being used, scientists at the Center for Genetics and Society and the activist group Friends of the Earth argued in their report.
“Once the process begins, there will be no going back. This is a line we must not cross,” said Pete Shanks, a consulting researcher with the Center for Genetics and Society and author of the report.
Advocates say the technology, CRISPR/Cas9, can speed the day that scientists can prevent heritable diseases. Opponents worry about unknown effects on future generations and the temptation for future parents to pay for genetic enhancements such as greater intelligence or athletic ability.
CRISPR/Cas9 allows scientists to manipulate genes like the “find and replace” function in word processing changes text. Scientists introduce enzymes that bind to a mutated gene, such as one associated with disease, and then replace or repair it.
The technique, if used to alter the DNA of human sperm, eggs, or embryos, holds the promise of eliminating a host of inherited diseases. But many scientists worry that this could produce unknown effects on future generations, since the changes are passed on to offspring.
Scientists note that the gene-editing techniques can also be used to alter the DNA of non-reproductive cells to repair diseased genes. The objections come to so-called “germline editing” in which reproductive cells are modified.
In May, the White House endorsed a ban on germline editing pending further study of the ethical issues.
The latest report was released on the eve of a summit convened by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and its counterparts from China and the United Kingdom, following a series of events this year that have brought new urgency to the debate.
In March, a group of scientists led by one key developer of the CRISPR technique called for a voluntary research ban on the use of the technology for germline editing, reflecting fears about safety and eugenics. Shortly after that, a team of Chinese scientists reported carrying out the first experiment to alter the DNA of human embryos.
That news ignited an outcry from some scientists, though others defended the Chinese research as careful and safe since it used only non-viable human embryos.
Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, has also been a leading opponent of genetically modified foods, including a recently approved salmon that grows faster than its wild cousins. The Center for Genetics and Society, founded in 2001, advocates for close oversight of human biotechnology. (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen. Editing by Jonathan Weber and David Gregorio)",0

AMERICAN ASTRONAUT, 2 OTHERS BACK ON EARTH AFTER 115 DAYS IN SPACE
Launched Thursday from Kazakhstan, the Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the 250-mile-high outpost just an hour or two before NASA launched a weather satellite from Florida. The Soyuz delivered NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. They joined three men already on board, one American and two Russians.
This is the third space station mission for Whitson, who at 56 is older than each of her crewmates.
LEGENDARY ASTRONAUTS CELEBRATE GRAND OPENING OF NEW SPACE EXHIBIT
She already holds the record for most time in space for a woman: nearly 400 days during her various missions. By the time she returns next spring, she should break the record for any American, man or woman.
""We could not be more proud,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Whitson once she entered the space station. He joined the new crew's family and friends at Russia's Mission Control outside Moscow to welcome the newcomers on board.
""I'm really happy to be here,"" Whitson replied.
A biochemist by training, Whitson will celebrate her 57th birthday at the orbiting lab in February. Until Thursday, no woman older than 55 had flown in space.
Pesquet, meanwhile, is making his first spaceflight and Novitskiy his second.
Before rocketing away, Pesquet told reporters he was taking up a piece of a Mars meteorite to illustrate the necessary union between human and robotic explorers. He intends to bring the stone back with him to Earth in six months. It then will launch aboard a Mars rover and return to its home planet.
""So it's going to be the most experienced space traveler there is in the world,"" Pesquet said Wednesday at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
""The idea is to show that space exploration is just the whole ... we're not competing against robotic exploration, we're all working together. What we do on the (space station) is just one step on that road to exploration.""
Sunday marks the 18th anniversary of the launch of the first space station piece. It's now as big as a football field, with a mass of 1 million pounds and eight miles of electrical wiring. Whitson and company represent its 50th full-time expedition.
""So we can celebrate the station's birthday today,"" said Sergei Krikalev, a cosmonaut-turned-space official who spoke from the Russian control center. ""Good luck.""",1

Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden has died at age 88, his family confirmed Wednesday.
Worden circled the moon alone in 1971 while, below, his two crewmates test-drove the first lunar rover.
A 1955 graduate of the United States Military Academy, Worden was commissioned into the Air Force. He logged more than 4,000 hours flying time, including 2,500 hours in jets, according to his NASA bio.

He was selected as an astronaut in April 1966 and served as part of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 9 and as backup command module pilot for Apollo 12. The Apollo 15 mission was Worden’s only spaceflight.
Worden flew to the moon along with David Scott and Jim Irwin. As command module pilot, Worden remained in lunar orbit aboard the Endeavour while Scott and Irwin descended to the surface and tried out NASA's first moon buggy.
Once his crewmates were back on board and headed home, Worden performed the first deep-space spacewalk — nearly 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) from Earth. He inspected the service module's science instrument bay and retrieved film. His foray outside lasted just 38 minutes.

“I’m deeply saddened to hear that Apollo astronaut Al Worden has passed away,” tweeted NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine on Wednesday. “Al was an American hero whose achievements in space and on Earth will never be forgotten. My prayers are with his family and friends.”
“‘Line of Grey, Be Thou at Peace!’ Godspeed Al,” tweeted Worden’s fellow West Point graduate Buzz Aldrin.

- Peggy Whitson has set the US record for most cumulative days in space
- She surpassed astronaut Jeff Williams' record of 534 days
(CNN)President Donald Trump congratulated NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson from the Oval Office on Monday on her record-breaking stay aboard the International Space Station.
Early Monday morning, Whitson officially set the US record for most cumulative days in space, surpassing astronaut Jeff Williams' record of 534 days, according to NASA.
Whitson arrived at the space station for her current stint on November 19, 2016, and is due to return to Earth in September.
Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump, alongside his daughter, Ivanka, and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, spoke via video with Whitson and fellow astronaut Jack Fischer.
""This is a very special day in the glorious history of American spaceflight,"" Trump said. ""You have broken the record for the most total time spent in space by an American astronaut. That's an incredible record to break.""
""On behalf of our nation and, frankly, on behalf of our world, I'd like to thank you,"" Trump continued.
""It's actually a huge honor to break a record like this,"" Whitson responded. ""It's an honor for me to be representing all the folks at NASA who make space travel possible and make me setting this record feasible.""
Trump, who praised the astronauts as ""our finest,"" jokingly expressed a preference for the space travelers over politicians.
""I've been dealing with politicians so much,"" Trump said. ""I'm so much more impressed with these people.""
The pair also discussed future travel to Mars, which is still decades away from happening.
""Getting there will require some international cooperation,"" Whitson said. ""Just because it is a very expensive endeavor. But it is so worthwhile doing.""
""We want to do that during my first term or, at worst, my second,"" Trump joked. ""We'll have to speed that up a little, OK?""
Informed of an experiment aboard the space station to convert urine to water -- which the astronauts have drunk, saying ""it's really not as bad as it sounds"" -- Trump quipped, ""Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. Better you than me.""
Whitson is the first woman to command the space station; she has commanded it twice. Her first stint as commander was in April 2008 and she's commanding the current crew.
She also holds the record for most spacewalks by a female astronaut. Whitson took her eighth spacewalk in March.",1
44,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/03/26/nasa-says-engine-issue-delays-crew-arrival-at-international-space-station.html,"NASA says engine issue delays crew's arrival at International Space Station
BAIKONUR, Khazakhstan – An engine snag has delayed the arrival of a Russian spacecraft carrying three astronauts to the International Space Station until Thursday, NASA said on Wednesday.
A rocket carrying Russians Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev and American Steve Swanson to the space station blasted off successfully early Wednesday from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
The Soyuz booster rocket lifted off as scheduled at 3:17 a.m. local time Wednesday (2117 GMT Tuesday), lighting up the night skies over the steppe with a giant fiery tail. It entered a designated orbit about 10 minutes after the launch and was expected to reach the space station in six hours. All onboard systems were working flawlessly, and the crew was feeling fine.
But NASA said in a statement on its website that the arrival was delayed after a 24-second engine burn that was necessary to adjust the Soyuz spacecraft's orbiting path ""did not occur as planned.""
The crew is in good spirits and is in no danger, but will have to wait until Thursday for the Soyuz TMA-12M to arrive and dock at the space station, NASA said. The arrival is now scheduled for 7:58 EDT (2358 GMT) Thursday.

Russian spacecraft used to routinely travel two days to reach the orbiting laboratory before last year. Wednesday would have been only the fifth time that a crew would have taken the six-hour ""fast-track"" route to the station.
NASA said that Moscow flight control has yet to determine why the engine burn did not occur.
The three astronauts traveling in the Soyuz will be greeted by Japan's Koichi Wakata, NASA's Rick Mastracchio and Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, who have been at the station since November. Wakata is the first Japanese astronaut to lead the station. The new crew is scheduled to stay in orbit for six months.
The joint mission is taking place at a time when U.S.-Russian relations on Earth are at their lowest ebb in decades, but the U.S. and Russia haven't allowed their disagreements over Ukraine to get in the way of their cooperation in space.
Swanson is a veteran of two U.S. space shuttle missions, and Skvortsov spent six months at the space outpost in 2010. Artemyev is on his first flight to space.
So far, the tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine have been kept at bay. Since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft as the only means to ferry crew to the orbiting outpost and back.
The U.S. is paying Russia nearly $71 million per seat to fly astronauts to the space lab through 2017. It's doing that at a time when Washington has led calls for sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine following a hastily-arranged referendum. So far the sanctions have been limited and haven't directly targeted the wider Russian economy.
Earlier this month, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden repeatedly said the conflict in Ukraine would have no effect on what's going on in space between the U.S. and Russia, saying that the ""partnership in space remains intact and normal.""
He said there's a long history of countries cooperating in orbit, while clashing on terra firma, which is why he said some people have nominated the 16-nation International Space Station for the Nobel Peace Prize.
At the same time, Bolden said on his blog Tuesday that while NASA continues to cooperate successfully with Russia, it wants to quickly get its own capacity to launch crews. NASA is trying to speed up private American companies' efforts to launch crews into orbit, but it needs extra funding to do so.
""But even as the `space race' has evolved over the past 50 years from competition to collaboration with Russia, NASA is rightfully focused now more than ever on returning our astronauts to space aboard American rockets -- launched from U.S. soil -- as soon as possible,"" he said.
NASA spokesman David Weaver said ""NASA is working aggressively to return human spaceflight launch to American soil, and end our sole reliance on Russia to get into space."" He added that later this year the agency plans to select the American companies that will transport its astronauts to the space station beginning in 2017.",1

Scientist He Jiankui said this week that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of the twin girls born this month.
He’s announcement, which has not been verified, sparked an international outcry about the ethics and safety of such research.
“The nature of this incident is extremely nasty, and relevant bodies have been ordered to temporarily halt the scientific research activities of relevant personnel,” the state news agency Xinhua said, citing the health ministry, science and technology ministry and China Association for Science and Technology.
The organizers of a conference where He claimed to have edited the genes also condemned the work on Thursday, calling it “deeply disturbing” and “irresponsible”.
“Even if the modifications are verified, the procedure was irresponsible and failed to conform with international norms,” the organizing committee of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, being held in Hong Kong this week, said in a statement.
The committee called for an independent assessment of He’s claims.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Chinese scientists have also condemned the work and the Southern University of Science and Technology, where He is on leave from his position as an associate professor, has announced an investigation.
The Guangdong province Health Commission said on its website on Wednesday it and Shenzhen city had set up a team to investigate the case.
He’s filing to a Chinese clinical trials database indicates that a hospital did an ethical review of the project, but the hospital involved denied that its ethics review committee ever met to discuss the work.
He said after his presentation on Wednesday he was proud of what he had done.
The presidents of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM) also expressed concern about He’s work.
“The events in Hong Kong this week clearly demonstrate the need for us to develop more specific standards and principles that can be agreed upon by the international scientific community,” NAS president Marcia McNutt and NAM president Victor Dzau said in a statement.

46,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/health/nasa-kelly-twins-study-results,"(CNN)Spending 340 days aboard the International Space Station between 2015 and 2016 caused changes in astronaut Scott Kelly's body, from his weight down to his genes, according to the results of the NASA Twins Study, released Thursday.
The majority of changes that occurred in Kelly's body, compared with his identical brother, Mark, on Earth, returned to normal once he came back from the space station. The study results suggest that human health can be ""mostly sustained"" for a year in space, the researchers said.
On a call with reporters Thursday, Mark thanked Scott for his service to the country and commitment to science by spending a year in space without knowing how it would affect him.
""I got all the glory, and you got all the work,"" Scott said, chiding his twin.
""And I got people coming to my house for tubes of blood,"" Mark replied in reference to the scientific samples taken during Scott's mission; Scott was collecting the same samples from himself to send back to researchers on Earth.

The results show ""the resilience and robustness of the human body,"" said Steven Platts, deputy chief scientist for NASA's Human Research Program, which coordinated the study.
Coincidentally, the results are being released just in time for the 58th anniversary of the first manned spaceflight by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
But the much-anticipated study reveals areas that may require countermeasures or safeguards when preparing for longer space missions or missions to deep space, like Mars.
The molecular, physiological and behavioral changes were divided into low-, mid-level and high-risk groups. Scott's change in body mass and microbiome were considered low-risk. Shifts in collagen regulation and blood vessel fluid management were mid-level, and genomic instability was regarded as potentially high-risk.
""When we go into space and experience microgravity and travel at speeds like 17,500 miles an hour, our bodies adapt and continue to function and, by and large, function extremely well,"" Platts said.
The study, which includes the work of 84 scientists who made up 10 teams from 12 universities in eight states, all studying different aspects of the human body in space, was published Thursday in the journal Science. The data included cognitive measurements, physiological data and 27 months of samples from both brothers, including blood, plasma, urine and stool.
However, there are limiting factors to the study, the researchers said.
The work is reflective of only Scott and Mark Kelly, and the results will not be corroborated with other astronauts, the researcher clarified. Scott was also still within the protective shield of Earth's magnetic field on the space station, not bombarded by deep-space radiation.
""It is impossible to attribute causality to spaceflight versus a co-incidental event,"" according to the study, so the researchers regard their work as ""hypothesis-generating and framework-defining"" that will benefit from more research in the future. But they also believe it's the ""dawn of human genomics in space,"" according to Dr. Andy Feinberg, principal investigator and professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
""The Twins Study has been an important step toward understanding epigenetics and gene expression in human spaceflight,"" said J.D. Polk, chief health and medical officer at NASA Headquarters. ""This has helped inform the need for personalized medicine and its role in keeping astronauts healthy during deep space exploration, as NASA goes forward to the Moon and journeys onward to Mars.""
Mark Kelly said he hopes it will happen in his lifetime. ""I'd even volunteer to be the person to get to go now that we know this about my brother, Scott.""
But he'll have to beat out his brother for that honor. ""I'm ready to go. Put me on a two-year flight,"" Scott said.
What changed in space
A year in space caused Scott's carotid artery to thicken, DNA damage, gene expression changes, a thickening of the retina, shifts in gut microbes, reduced cognitive abilities and a structural change at the ends of chromosomes called telomeres. But it did not alter or mutate his DNA.
Getting a flu shot in space also worked exactly as it did on Earth. Nutrition and exercise while on the station caused weight loss and an increase in folic acid that caused the vital production of red blood cells.
The changes in gene expression were connected to DNA repair systems and the immune system. More than 1,000 genes changed as soon as Scott arrived in space. Some of the changes were expected, like those related to bone formation or repairing DNA, because astronauts lose bone density in space and radiation damages DNA. But the changes to mitochondrial and immune system genes, which help produce energy and protect the body, suggest that long-term spaceflight increases stress on the body. There was also evidence of cellular stress.
This reveals that Scott's immune system was on high alert in response to his environmental change, the researchers said.
""Gene expression changed dramatically,"" said Christopher Mason, one of the study authors and associate professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine. ""While many of the changes reversed after Scott returned to Earth, a few remained, including cognitive deficits, DNA damage and some changes in T-cell activation. We don't know yet if these changes are good or bad. This could just be how the body responds, but the genes are perturbed, so we want to see why and track them to see for how long.""
There was also a more dramatic change in genes during the last half of the mission compared with the first half, with six times the number of genes changing later.
Looking at Scott and Mark's epigenomes only revealed a less than 5% difference. Epigenomes are chemical compounds that act like a switch to turn genes on or off in DNA. Epigenentic changes are tweaks to gene activity that don't change the genetic code. For Scott, the changes involved his immune system response and in biochemical markers attached to inflammation.
While in space, the caps on the ends of chromosomes called telomeres lengthened in Scott's white blood cells. Usually, a change in telomere length is associated with aging or disease, and they shorten with age. The lengthening wasn't expected. Telomeres act like a biomarker for health and, now, the long-term risks of spaceflight.
Upon returning to Earth, Scott's telomeres quickly shortened and even lost length compared with how they were before he left for the space station. This could be a negative effect on his cellular health, the researchers said. Now, he has more short telomeres. Short telomeres are associated with a higher risk for accelerated aging, cardiovascular disease and some cancers, said Susan Bailey, study author and Colorado State University professor.
Scott's eyeballs also changed shape. His retinal nerve sthickened, and folds appeared in the choroid layer around the eye. The changes are associated with vision clarity and have been noted in other male astronauts because of the headward fluid shift of zero gravity. It's called space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome or SANS. That same fluid shift caused a distension of the neck's jugular vein, more cardiac output and a thickening of the forehead's skin. This puts deep pressure on veins, eyes and blood vessels and causes drainage.
The fluid shift affected not only his eyes but his cardiovascular system, as well. Scott's carotid artery wall thickened early in the mission and remained that way for the rest of the flight. Collagen levels in his blood shifted, which was associated with changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Those returned to baseline when he returned.
While Scott's gut microbiome shifted, the diversity of it didn't, which was encouraging to researchers. Comparing Scott's samples before, during and after the flight was more valuable than comparing them to Mark's, the researchers said. While in space, the number of gut bacteria called Firmicutes increased, while the gut bacteria Bacteroidetes decreased. Both categories contain a mix of good and bad bacteria.
Researchers believe that zero gravity caused this shift. But the balance returned to normal when Scott returned to Earth. Countermeasures to help maintain this balance in the future could include pre-, pro- or postbiotics.
Scott's cognitive speed and accuracy decreased in tests postflight and persisted up to six months after he returned.
There was also an uptick in immune response during Scott's landing on Earth, which aligns with such a stressful event. And his lactic acid levels were higher during the first 15 days and final 14 days of the trip, although the exact trigger has not been identified.
But almost everything returned to normal, stable or baseline levels six months after Scott returned to Earth.
Scott said that returning from a year in space was ""significantly different"" from returning from a six-month mission. ""The return was much worse than the adjustment"" to the space station.
Scott said he felt like he had the flu during his first few days back on Earth. He experienced joint and muscle pain, swelling in the lower legs, hives and rashes anywhere his skin touched anything, dizziness, nausea and fatigue.
He believes it was all due to the return to gravity, exposure to different people and their immune systems, and an emotional reaction to such a dramatic experience. It took about six months to feel 100% again.
""He is back to virtually normal,"" said Dr. Mike Snyder, investigator and director for Stanford University's Department of Genetics.
Platts said that ""if you look at the changes that were seen in Scott, the vast majority of them came back to baseline at a relatively short period of time when he returned to Earth, and those that did not return very quickly were markers of things we already knew were likely to happen,"" such as stress and inflammatory markers.
He said the study both has new findings and reinforces what was known.
Protecting astronaut health
Scott first proposed the idea to NASA's Human Research Program before his mission. The twins are both astronauts, but a unique opportunity was presented when Scott planned to spend a year on the space station while his brother remained on Earth. Their identical genes would provide the perfect comparison for researchers. And going forward, NASA is proposing more one-year missions to continue this kind of research and to prepare for longer missions to Mars or the moon.
After more than 50 years of human spaceflight, researchers know some of the risks posed to the human body by being in zero gravity. Astronauts have to deal with a stressful environment, noise, isolation, disrupted circadian rhythm, radiation exposure and a headward fluid shift that happens when floating as opposed standing on solid ground.
Space motion sickness occurs in the first 48 hours, creating a loss of appetite, dizziness and vomiting.
Over time, astronauts staying for six months or more on the station can experience the weakening and loss of bone and muscle atrophy. Astronauts also experience blood volume loss, weakened immune systems and cardiovascular deconditioning since floating takes little effort and the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood. Scott and other astronauts in their late 40s and 50s have also complained about their vision being slightly altered. Some of them have required glasses in flight.
Going forward, NASA is focused on addressing the key threats to humans traveling in space: isolation and confinement, radiation, distance from Earth, hostile or closed environments and fluctuating gravity.
""This will guide future biomedical space research and allow us to have a safer journey to and from Mars,"" Platts said.
Implications on earth too
But these findings don't just have implications for astronauts. Cancer patients also undergo genetic changes and radiation exposure. This study shows how a healthy body responds and adapts to stress, which could separate out how the body responds to other stressors, cancer or infections.
""The science that we do in space impacts our nation for generations,"" Mark Kelly said.
In addition, the study sheds light on individual responses to flu vaccines, environment-related changes in gene expression, ailments related to intracranial pressure, visual system impairments and cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis.
Bailey, the telomere researcher, will continue her work by studying astronauts on six-month and one-year missions. Understanding the individual factors behind telomeres could show what influences their dynamics.
""The Twins Study demonstrated on the molecular level the resilience and robustness of how one human body adapted to the spaceflight environment,"" said Jenn Fogarty, chief scientist for NASA 's Human Research Program. ""This study was a stepping stone to future biological space research focusing on molecular changes and how they may predict health and performance of astronauts. It opened the door to new research strategies that are already being advanced in other studies.""",1

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – NASA is paying $424 million more to Russia to get U.S. astronauts into space, and the agency's leader is blaming Congress for the extra expense.
NASA announced its latest contract with the Russian Space Agency on Tuesday. The $424 million represents flights to and from the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft, as well as training, for six astronauts in 2016 and the first half of 2017.
That's $70.6 million per seat -- well above the previous price tag of about $65 million.
Russia currently provides the only means of getting people to and from the space station, and its ticket prices have soared with each new contract.
Several U.S. companies are working on rockets and spacecraft to launch Americans from U.S. soil. But that's still a few years away. The ability to launch crews into orbit from America ended with NASA's shuttle program in 2011. Even before the shuttles retired, the U.S. had been relying on Russia to transport long-term residents to the space station.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said if Congress had approved the space agency's request for more funding for its commercial space effort, the latest contract would have been unnecessary. He is urging full funding of the Obama administration's 2014 budget request of $821 million in seed money for the commercial crew program.
""Because the funding for the President's plan has been significantly reduced, we now won't be able to support American launches until 2017,"" Bolden, a former shuttle commander, wrote in a NASA blog.
It could take longer if Congress does not fully support the 2014 request, he said.
""Further delays in our Commercial Crew Program and its impact on our human spaceflight program are unacceptable,"" Bolden said.
The California-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, already is making cargo shipments to the space station. Its founder and chief designer, billionaire Elon Musk, previously has said his company could be ferrying astronauts aboard beefed-up versions of its Dragon capsules by 2015.
Orbital Sciences Corp. of Virginia completed a successful test launch 1 1/2 weeks ago. It plans to start sending supplies to the space station this summer, but has no interest in carrying passengers.
The six seats included in the latest Russian contract covers not only Americans, but European, Canadian or Japanese astronauts under barter agreements between NASA and those countries.",1

- Charles Bolden: World eager to get in on new era of space exploration
- NASA's Orion spacecraft to blast off on first test flight this week
- NASA is breathing new life into an American dream, he says
Everywhere you look, there is renewed interest in space. Two of the top grossing movies of the past two years were ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar,"" while recent real-life space dramas have been even more fascinating than fiction.
Take the unprecedented 37-year, 12-billion-mile odyssey of NASA's Voyager spacecraft -- the first human-made object to venture into interstellar space. In 2012, our Curiosity rover made its harrowing landing on Mars. We also provided key support and instruments to the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft and the recent first-ever robotic landing on a comet with its Philae lander.
Everywhere I go, the world over, students, citizens, scientists, explorers and entrepreneurs are eager to get in on the action in this new era of space exploration. And we are just a few days from yet another extraordinary milestone toward a human journey to Mars.
On Thursday, NASA's Orion spacecraft will blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on its first test flight -- a major step in meeting President Barack Obama's bold challenge, supported by Congress, that America send humans to Mars by the 2030s.
As the administrator of NASA, I am excited by the opportunity to launch this historic journey. As a former astronaut, I am proud and a bit envious of the amazing men and women -- members of our elite astronaut corps -- who are now in training to perhaps be the first people to set foot on the surface of another planet.
Our uncrewed test flight will send Orion 3,600 miles above Earth, farther into space than any craft designed for astronauts has gone since the last Apollo moon mission more than 40 years ago.
The mission has two primary goals. First, as we have seen with two recent launch failures, space travel is a dangerous business, which is why this test flight will stress systems critical to ensuring the safety of future astronauts. These include the heat shield, parachutes, avionics and attitude control. We intend to learn as much as possible before Orion carries astronauts to explore an asteroid and then on a journey to Mars.
Our second major goal is to expose the spacecraft to the orbital environment it will endure on missions into deep space. We will measure Orion's performance from launch through its four-hour flight, splashdown and recovery in the Pacific Ocean.
NASA is leveraging expertise and resources from across the agency to achieve this next giant leap in space exploration. For example, Curiosity measured radiation on the way to Mars and is now sending back radiation data from the Martian surface. In September, NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission) became the first orbiter to study the Martian upper atmosphere, MAVEN will greatly improve our understanding of how Mars has changed over time and the potential for habitability. Our deep-space exploration program is also driving development of technologies such as solar electric propulsion, which will power tomorrow's missions.
NASA is also changing the way we do business, beginning with our commitment to help build an American commercial space industry that is second to none. As President Obama has said, the greatest nation on earth should not be dependent on other nations to get into space. That is why we are now forming partnerships with American aerospace companies to ferry cargo, and soon humans, to and from the International Space Station. These commercial partnerships are proving that America works best when government and private-sector ingenuity work as a team. Our commercial partners are not only allowing NASA to focus on our big goal of a human mission to Mars, they are also creating good jobs and strengthening our economy.
The world has learned much about the Red Planet after decades of exploration with rovers and orbiters, but the time has come for human exploration, and we intend to meet the challenge. The Orion test flight is the first step. It is important to remember that NASA sent humans to the moon by setting a goal that seemed beyond our reach. With our Journey to Mars program, NASA is once again well on its way to breathing new life into an American dream and turning science fiction into science fact.

A veteran astronaut crew representing the United States, Russia and Japan is returning back to Earth aboard a Soyuz capsule today (Nov. 18) to wrap up a four-month mission to the International Space Station.
The Soyuz spacecraft undocked from the space station at 5:26 p.m. EST (2126 GMT) as both ships sailed 256 miles (412 kilometers) above northwestern China. The Soyuz is due to land on the Central Asian steppes of Kazakhstan at 8:53 p.m. EST (0153 Nov. 19 GMT) to return American astronaut Sunita Williams of NASA, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide to Earth after 127 days in space.
The trio will make a rare night landing when their Soyuz TMA-05M capsule lands in Kazakhstan. At landing time, it is expected to be a cold night with an hour to go before sunrise, NASA officials said. You can watch the Soyuz landing live here via SPACE.com's NASA TV feed.
""Good luck, guys,"" American astronaut Kevin Ford, who now commands the station's Expedition 34 crew, as the Soyuz departed.
Williams, who commanded the station's Expedition 33 mission, turned control of the outpost over to Ford on Saturday (Nov. 17). The command change marked the start of the station's Expedition 34 mission by Ford and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin, who arrived at the station in late October. [Photos: Space Station's Expedition 33 Mission]
""I think we've left this ship in good shape and I'm honored to hand it over to Kevin,"" Williams told Ford before presenting gifts to Expedition 34 crew in an emotional exchange. ""As you can see, we have a great crew up her, us who are going home very shortly and the ones who are taking over. The ship's in good hands.""
Williams, Malenchenko and Hoshide launched into orbit in mid-July, with Williams becoming the second female commander of the space station when she took charge earlier this year. Williams, an avid runner, became ran the first triathlon in space during the mission, which also featured three spacewalks and the first official cargo delivery by a robotic Dragon spacecraft built by the U.S. company SpaceX.
The Soyuz spacecraft ferrying Williams and her crewmates back to Earth is due to fire its rocket engine to leave orbit at 7:58 p.m. EST (0058 Nov. 19 GMT) and land in Kazakhstan just under one hour later. It will be the first night landing of a Soyuz spacecraft since the Expedition 12 mission in 2006, NASA officials said.
A fleet of eight helicopters carrying recovery teams and vehicles will be circling the Soyuz spacecraft's primary and backup landing zones in order to ensure a swift retrieval of the returning astronauts.
As Williams and her crew readapt to life on Earth, the Expedition 34 crew still on the space station will prepare for a busy holiday season in orbit. The astronaut and cosmonauts are expected to celebrate the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday (Nov. 22) and prepare for the arrival of three new crewmembers in mid-December.
A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko will launch to the space station on Dec. 19 from the Central Asian spaceport of Baikonur Cosmondrome in Kazakhstan.
The International Space Station is the largest manmade structure in space. It was built by five different space agencies representing the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada, with construction beginning in 1998. The $100 billion space station has been continuously occupied by a series of rotating astronaut crews since 2000.",1

But how would they go about scooping up soil from the surface of a distant planet and getting it back here? With a plan that sounds straight out of sci-fi.
Described by the project’s lead scientist in a virtual meeting reported by Nature, NASA and the European Space Agency’s proposed Mars sample retrieval program is perhaps the most ambitious interplanetary mission ever devised. (I’ve asked NASA for more details and will update this post if I hear back.)
The first part of the plan is already public: It relies on the Mars Perseverance rover, which is currently being prepared, despite the pandemic, for its launch in July. Perseverance will perform sampling using a drill and soil scoop, filling 30 small tubes with the results of its Martian delvings and storing them on board.
The next step is where things start to get wild.
A second spacecraft will travel to Mars, launching in 2026 and arriving in 2028, and land near Perseverance in Jezero crater. It will deploy a second rover, which will roll over to Perseverance, collect the sample tubes, and deposit them in the “Mars ascent vehicle” that also came with it. This small rocket will launch itself and the samples into orbit — the first time a spacecraft will have taken off from the surface of Mars.
At this point, a third spacecraft waiting nearby will synchronize its orbit with the sample retrieval craft, collect it, and return to Earth with it, where it will make its — controlled, one hopes — reentry in 2031.
“This is by no means a simple task,” said head of NASA’s Mars exploration program Jim Watzin in the meeting, uttering perhaps the greatest understatement of the 21st century so far. “But we have kept it as simple as possible.”
Indeed, it is hard to think of a simpler process given the restrictions of travel to Mars. Naturally Perseverance can’t shoot the samples back on a ballistic trajectory itself for a variety of reasons. That necessitates a second surface vehicle. And engineering that vehicle to fill the roles of outbound spacecraft, lander, rover, ascent vehicle, and return spacecraft may simply be impossible. So a third spacecraft is needed as well.
Keep in mind that this is the mission profile, but the actual spacecraft don’t exist yet, and likely won’t for years to come. Still, it’s a mind-blowing plan that NASA has just revealed.",1

The Russian Soyuz rocket carrying Alexander Skvortsov, Oleg Artemyev and NASA astronaut Steven Swanson was due to dock with the ISS early Wednesday, only six hours after it was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
A technical glitch on its approach in orbit caused a two-day delay in their docking.

The trio were using a fast-track approach to the ISS completed by only four previous crewed missions. They will now orbit the Earth 34 times instead of the four orbits originally envisaged.
US-Russia space cooperation has been unaffected by the political and economic fallout triggered by Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is due to fly to the ISS in May, said that “politics starts to fall by the wayside” when working with Russian space engineers, flight controllers and cosmonauts on a daily basis.

“We're three really good friends climbing into a Soyuz (capsule) to fly into space. All politics aside, there's no doubt it's going to work for us,” he added.
NASA relies on Russia to deliver astronauts to the station through the Soyuz capsule and to provide the rocket power essential for major station manoeuvres.
The ISS requires tight cooperation between US and Russian flight control centres to keep it adequately supplied and staffed.
John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University described the relationship as a “mutual dependency”.
“It's certainly not in our interest to so alienate Russia that we no longer had access to the station,” he added. “So, I think the by far most likely outcome is kind of encapsulating the station from the broader political currents”.",1
53,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gene-editing-charpentier-idUSKBN0TL2YL20151202?feedType=RSS&feedName=scienceNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the scientists who discovered powerful tools for altering genes is not convinced the case has been made for using the technology on human sperm, eggs and embryos.
“The tools are not ready,” biologist Emmanuelle Charpentier said in an interview on Wednesday during a global meeting on the technology.
Changes made in the genes of human reproductive cells, known as germline cells, would be passed along to future generations. Several groups have called for restrictions on use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9, which has opened new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.
At the meeting, several researchers presented potential near-term uses of the technology that would require the editing of germline cells. They include editing immature sperm cells to allow infertile men to father children.
But Charpentier, one of the scientists credited with discovering the technology, said: “As of today, I’m in favor of not having the manipulation of the human germlines.”
“As long as they are not perfect and ready, I think it’s good to have this ban against editing the germline,” said Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin and Umea University, Sweden.
Charpentier and colleague Jennifer Doudna of the University of California at Berkeley did pioneering work on developing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a technology that can strategically delete specific stretches of DNA and add in genes.
She said she would need very strong convincing about the immediate benefits of editing human germline cells. “For the moment, I don’t see any.”
DIFFERING REGULATIONS
Charpentier is a member of the German National Academy of Sciences, a country where research involving germline editing is banned.
But regulations vary. In Britain, scientists can apply for a license to edit the germline. In the United States, researchers are banned from using federal funding for the research, but the work is permitted in private labs.
Such work has already taken place in China, where a team of scientists reported carrying out the first experiment to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos.
That ignited an outcry and a call for a voluntary ban on such work by a group of leading biologists, including Doudna.
But the work is still going on. “The moratorium didn’t have much effect,” Charpentier said.
Her hope is that the meeting produces a framework that will provide guidance to other scientists as this work proceeds. The three-day Washington meeting was convened by the National Academies of Medicine and Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of the United Kingdom.
Several scientists expressed concern on Tuesday the germline controversy might hamper research on non-reproductive cells, known as somatic cells, that could potentially help people with inherited or infectious diseases.
Fyodor Urnov, senior scientist at Sangamo Biosciences, a company using a different gene editing tool to create treatments in somatic cells, said the company wrote an article in Nature calling for a moratorium on germline research.
“We don’t want there to be a conflation in the mind of the public or in the mind of the regulators or policymakers or the ethical community between the two,” Urnov said in an interview.

The Russian Soyuz rocket carrying American Peggy Whitson, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and French astronaut Thomas Pesquet lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 3:20 p.m. EST (2020 GMT).
Whitson, 56, a biochemist and NASA’s former chief astronaut, is making her third trip to the station, a $100 million research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (420 km) above Earth.
By the time she returns to Earth in six months, she will have accumulated more time in orbit than any other U.S. astronaut, surpassing the 534-day record set in September by astronaut Jeff Williams.
“The most important thing about the station is the friendships and the work we accomplish there,” Whitson said during a prelaunch news conference on Wednesday in Kazakhstan.
Novitskiy, 45, who is making his second spaceflight, added: “The station is ... a place where we can demonstrate to the entire world that you can have normal relations, where you can work without being distracted by things that don’t really matter.”
Joining the veteran fliers is Pesquet, 38, a rookie astronaut representing the European Space Agency.
The crew is due to reach the station at 5:01 p.m. EST (2201 GMT) on Saturday, where it will be greeted by NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough and Russian flight engineers Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko, who arrived on Oct. 21.
The combined crew will be one of the last six-member teams to live on the station for a while. Beginning in March, Russia plans to cut the number of cosmonauts serving on the station to two from three, following delays in launching a new science laboratory. The Multipurpose Laboratory Module is now expected to be launched in 2018.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Three astronauts flew to the International Space Station on Thursday, departing the virus-plagued planet with little fanfare and no family members at the launch site to bid them farewell.
NASA’s Chris Cassidy and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner arrived at the orbiting lab in their Soyuz capsule six hours after blasting off from Kazakhstan. They joined two Americans and one Russian who will return to Earth in a week.
There was no social distancing 260 miles (420 kilometers) up: As they floated into the space station one by one, the new astronauts embraced the three already there. They had been in prelaunch quarantine for the past month.
The newest crew members will remain on board until October, keeping the outpost running until SpaceX launches a pair of NASA astronauts from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, as early as next month. It will be the first orbital launch of astronauts from the U.S. since NASA’s space shuttle program ended in 2011.
Thursday’s liftoff was low-key even by Russian standards, given the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. NASA televised the liftoff live as usual, but only a few Russia-based employees of the space agency were at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
Cassidy’s wife, Peggy, watched the launch from NASA’s Mission Control in Houston. She returned home a few weeks ago, after saying goodbye to her husband at cosmonaut headquarters in Star City, Russia.
“No virus is stronger than the human desire to explore,” tweeted NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “I’m grateful to the entire @NASA and @roscosmos teams for their dedication to making this launch a success.”
On the eve of liftoff, the astronauts said they felt fantastic after being in strict quarantine. The sparse crowds mostly stayed a safe distance from the astronauts; even the Orthodox priest offering the customary blessing stood several feet away.
“Obviously, we’d love to have our families here with us, but it’s what we understand we have to do to be safe,” Cassidy said Wednesday. “The whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.”
Added Ivanishin: “We’ve been completely isolated at this final stage of training.”
There was another twist, besides coronavirus: Ivanishin and Vagner were assigned to the flight just two months ago, after one of the original Russian crewmen suffered an eye injury.
Because of the late crew swap, Ivanishin and Vagner had no clothes waiting for them at the space station. They took a few extra outfits with them on the Soyuz, with more due to arrive on the next Russian supply ship later this month.
Officials from NASA and the Russian Space Agency were among only a few to address the astronauts, protected behind a glass wall, before they departed for the launch pad. The room normally is packed with family, friends and space program types; on Thursday, the rows of seats were almost all empty. Journalists were among those kept away.
“It was a stunning launch and docking,” NASA’s Mission Control radioed from Houston after the crew arrived. “And while we wish we had everyone to see you off from Baikonur, we know your family and friends, and your NASA family, were watching the whole way and couldn’t be more proud.”
“We’re just really happy to get here,” replied Cassidy, a Navy captain.
This is the third spaceflight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and the first for Vagner.
Already on board — and due to return to Earth on April 17 — are NASA’s Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka.
The director of Roscosmos — Russia’s space agency — said earlier this week that nine employees have tested positive for coronavirus. Roscosmos controls a sprawling network of production plants and launch facilities, and has about 200,000 employees, said director Dmitry Rogozin, who attended Thursday’s launch.

China's National Health Commission has ordered an investigation into He Jiankui's experiment, which was condemned by the scientific community in China and abroad.
Chinese science and technology vice minister Xu Nanping said the ""gene-edited babies incident as reported by media blatantly violated our country's relevant laws and regulations"".
The claims were ""shocking and unacceptable"" and breached ""the bottom line of morality and ethics that the academic community adheres to"", he told CCTV.
The science and technology ministry ""firmly opposes"" the experiment and ""has already demanded that the relevant organisation suspend the scientific activities of relevant personnel,"" Xu added.
The experiment, which was led by He, claims to have successfully altered the DNA of twin girls born a few weeks ago to prevent them from contracting HIV.
The scientist had told a packed biomedical conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday he was ""proud"" to have successfully altered the DNA of the twins.
But details of the experiment, which has not been independently verified, triggered an immediate backlash and He said the trial had been ""paused"".
He was supposed to speak at the conference again on Thursday, but he disappeared from the schedule.
David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate and chairman of the organising committee, told reporters it was He's decision not to attend.
- 'A bit crazy' -
The founder of an HIV support group reported to be based in Beijing said Thursday that he regretted introducing families to He for the trial, according to Hong Kong media.
Bai Hua, the group's head, said he had introduced 50 families to He's team.
""In the beginning we did not understand what it was they were really doing. Actually right now my personal feeling is that they are a bit crazy,"" he told RTHK.
Bai added that he had spoken to two of the families involved in the trial and questioned whether the risks and ethical issues had been fully explained to them.
""The team all along emphasised that the chance of success was high, and that there were risks, but they were low,"" he told RTHK.
In Hong Kong, Organisers of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing denounced He's ""unexpected and deeply disturbing"" claim that human embryos had been edited and implanted, and called for closer supervision of the field at the conclusion of the conference Thursday.
""Even if the modifications are verified, the procedure was irresponsible and failed to conform with international norms,"" they said in a statement.
""Its flaws include an inadequate medical indication, a poorly designed study protocol, a failure to meet ethical standards for protecting the welfare of research subjects, and a lack of transparency in the development, review and conduct of clinical procedures,"" it added.
- Life-long impact -
Eight volunteer couples -- HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers -- signed up to He's trial, with one dropping out before it was put on hold.
Professor He said there had been ""another potential pregnancy"" involving a second couple, but it is unclear whether that pregnancy is still ongoing.
Experts warned that editing human embryos can create unintended mutations in other areas -- so-called ""off-target effects"" -- which can have an impact through the lifetime.
Southern University of Science and Technology distanced itself from He, saying he had been on unpaid leave since February and had ""seriously violated academic ethics"".
The Stanford-educated researcher said the twins' DNA was modified using CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
Co-creator of the technology Jennifer Doudna said she felt ""horrified"" at hearing He's talk, adding she was deeply concerned for the people affected and questioned whether they really understood the procedure.
Summit organisers said germline genome editing could become ""acceptable"" in future if rigorous criteria are met, but that there are too many scientific and technical uncertainties to permit clinical trials at this stage.

An experiment in China to alter the genomes of embryos in vitro, then implant them in the mother, is a step too far.
Dr. Topol is a professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute.
Sooner or later it was bound to happen: A rogue scientist in China claims to have edited a gene in two human embryos and implanted them in the mother’s womb, resulting in the birth of genetically altered twin girls. We’re no longer in the realm of science fiction. If true, this hacking of their biological operating instructions, which they will pass on to their children and generations to come, is a dangerous breach of medical ethics and responsible research and must be condemned.
This is not to say that medicine won’t someday employ gene-editing technologies in similar ways. But that time has not arrived. There are still too many risks, too many unknowns, about tinkering with our heritable genetic blueprints.
In recent years genome editing has been appropriately heralded as the most important advance of biotechnology of our generation, and most likely the past century. Known as Crispr, this technique, and related DNA editing tools, enable their users to cut and paste discrete letters of the genome. This ability has markedly advanced science, shedding new light on the complex human genome with its billions of A, C, T and G letters that are the architecture of who we are.
Already, many clinical trials using this technology are underway involving patients with rare diseases like hemophilia, thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The difference between these efforts and what reportedly happened in China is that these genome editing trials involve cells from the patient’s body. The manipulations are not transmissible to the next generation.
These trials are in their early stages, and we don’t yet have results to show whether this type of editing is safe or provides effective treatment. But whatever happens, the consequences are confined to a patient who has consented to the experimental treatment.
While there have been reports of human embryo editing experiments in laboratory petri dishes, until now, so far as we know, none of these embryos have been implanted in humans. In such cases, the hazards become markedly amplified because the editing intervenes in so-called germ line cells that are transmitted from one generation to another. Conceivably every cell in the body, some 37 trillion, could be programmed with the edits.
In the Chinese study, led by He Jiankui, a physicist, not a medical doctor, on the faculty of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, the targeted gene was CCR5, which helps enable H.I.V. to enter cells. While preventing this intrusion might sound like an advance in the fight against AIDS, it is completely unnecessary and may even carry the hazard of increasing the subject’s susceptibility to other types of infection, such as influenza and West Nile fever. Previous genome editing studies have shown it is possible to disable the CCR5 gene in adults without working at the embryo level.
So the experiment was needless. It had no scientific basis and must be considered unethical when balanced against the known and unknown risks.
The predominant risks are the potential impacts of the editing on other letters of the genome, which could induce diseases. We don’t have the assurance yet that Crispr provides laserlike precision in editing — for example, certain important genes for suppressing cancer are particularly susceptible to unintended editing. The way we assess this risk is to sequence the genome before and after editing, to see whether changes were made in genes other than the target gene.
But our ability to discern these changes is still rudimentary, and it is entirely likely that we will miss something. The fact that we may not have seen unintended mutations brought about by editing is by no means proof of their absence.
With six billion letters in the genome that could be affected, the risk of unintended editing is considerable and requires extensive scrutiny to understand and mitigate. That’s partly why the implantation of edited human embryos has been widely banned.
Even beyond the actual editing, this episode appears to have been marked by breaches of scientific conduct. One issue is informed consent. It is unclear whether the parents were told that there were simple ways to protect the embryos from disease that might have been transmitted by the H.I.V.-infected father. If they had known that, why would they consent to this risky procedure?
Moreover, no report by the researchers has been produced for the biomedical community to review. Through a journalist reporting about this, I had the opportunity to see some of the data, and there’s little question that Dr. He at least attempted to edit the genomes of the embryos. But no sequencing data has been presented or independently assessed.
Nor has data been released to show whether the targeted gene was functionally disabled, which would require cell experiments. Science demands such transparency, but all we have is a YouTube video by the researcher, who makes the bold claim that “the gene surgery was safe.”
Dr. He’s university has disavowed knowledge or support of the research and said an inquiry is underway. It said his “conduct in utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to edit human embryos has seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct.”
It is difficult to envision a foolproof way to rein in such rogue efforts, notwithstanding the international consensus that we are still nowhere near ready for genome-edited babies. Scientists like Dr. He should be castigated by their institutions and the biomedical community, as he was, and perhaps that will discourage this sort of unethical research. Governments should also condemn these practices and impose significant penalties, like pulling research funding and making these scientists ineligible for more.
We don’t know whether the intended human genome editing was achieved in the twins and have no idea whether it will prove to be safe if it was accomplished.
But we can conclude that this was a misguided, reckless use of powerful gene-altering tools to create edited human beings. We should not proceed down this road until we know far more about the consequences of what we are doing.

58,https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/nasa-confirms-commercial-crew-still-a-priority-but-james-webb-telescope-testing-and-other-activities-paused/,"NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has been sharing regular updates about how his agency is approaching the rapidly changing global coronavirus pandemic situation. This week, NASA escalated its response multiple times due to changing circumstances, including changing the state of working conditions at all of its facilities across the country. On Friday the agency summarized the current status of each of its facilities and major projects in a comprehensive update.
Work continues on a few missions that are deemed critical, and on projects where remote and telework are possible. These include the Commercial Crew Program, which is set to return human spaceflight capabilities to American soil via private partners. Boeing and SpaceX are NASA’s partners for this program, and NASA says that this is going ahead despite the requirement of in-person operations because it represents “a critical element to maintaining safe operations on the International Space Station and a sustained U.S. presence on the orbiting laboratory.” SpaceX and NASA confirmed earlier this week that they still plan to launch the first crewed Dragon mission to the ISS in mid to late May.
For the purpose of keeping ISS crew “fully supplied and safe,” NASA says that it will continue to operate its commercial resupply missions, too, which ferry experiments, food, water and more to the space station using vehicles including SpaceX’s Dragon cargo capsule. For similar reasons, it’ll keep open the Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center, with flight control personnel in place, though it’s adding “additional measures” to ensure the safety of those present.
Meanwhile, work on the James Webb Telescope in California is temporarily suspended, which means the integration and testing that was happening in preparation for its planned launch next March. Preparations for NASA’s Mars 2020 launch, which includes its Perseverance rover and Mars Helicopter exploration vehicles also continue: that mission is scheduled for July 2020.
There’s also virtual inspection work being done on the X-59 piloted supersonic test plane that’s being developed in California, and Lockheed Martin, which is building the aircraft for the agency, is continuing in-person work on that project. NASA is keeping the lights on at Ames Research Center in California, too, in order to ensure that the agency’s IT security and supercomputing operations can continue uninterrupted.
Existing spacecraft mission support will continue, as will astronaut training (which is generally subject to strict isolation protocols to prevent illness anyway). Earlier this week, the agency announced it would suspend work on the SLS spacecraft and the Orion capsule that will carry the fundamental components of its Artemis program, which aims to get humans back to the Moon, and eventually to Mars. Artemis has been sticking to a stated 2024 time frame for its mission of returning people to the surface of the Moon, but these setbacks in total represent the most sure sign yet that we’ll probably see that window slip, though many skeptical of the schedule have suggested it would actually be later than that anyway.",1
59,https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/nasa-and-spacex-targeting-mid-to-late-may-for-first-astronaut-launch-despite-coronavirus-pandemic/,"NASA and SpaceX issued a media accreditation invitation on Wednesday for their Demonstration Mission 2 (aka Demo-2) commercial crew launch – the first in the commercial crew program that will carry actual astronauts to space. The invite includes the current proposed timeframe for the mission, listed as no “no earlier than mid-to-late May.”
Reports from earlier in the year had pegged the launch window for May, with the possibility that SpaceX and NASA could move that to as early as April, or as late as June, depending on the preparedness of the spacecraft and crew. SpaceX was reportedly early on readying the Crew Dragon spacecraft that would be flying the mission, but NASA also changed the mission parameters to include a longer stay at the International Space Station for the crew going up on the demo mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.
This will be the first time ever that astronauts fly aboard a SpaceX spacecraft, and the first crewed mission for the commercial crew program, through which NASA is working with private company launch operators to return human spaceflight capabilities to American soil. All current astronaut transportation to and from the International Space Station is accomplished through a partnership with Russia’s Roscosmos space agency, which flies crews using its Soyuz spacecraft.
So far, NASA and SpaceX haven’t seemed to be anticipating much of a change to the timing of their first crewed Dragon mission in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. This invitation from NASA is the most detailed confirmation yet that the mission is still on as of right now, and tracking towards a launch window that seems unchanged from plans prior to the implementation of strict social distancing and isolation measures as the COVID-19 epidemic flared across the U.S.
NASA recently moved all of its facilities to a ‘Stage 3’ state of contingency operation, which means all employees are on mandatory telework unless they’re required to be physically present in office for mission-related activity. NASA’s Ames facility has been escalated to Stage 4, because of the ‘shelter-in-place’ order in effect in the California county in which it resides, which means that the facility is closed and only telework is permitted.
In the invitation issued to media today, NASA says that it’s “proactively monitoring the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation as it evolves” and will “communicate any updates that may impact mission planing or media access, as they become available.” The agency is also taking extra precautions to protect the health of Hurley and Behnken, in addition to standard isolation procedures already in place to prevent them from getting sick ahead of a spaceflight mission.",1
60,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-astronaut-idUSKBN17Q1RD,"(Reuters) - U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson broke the 534-day U.S. record for cumulative time in space on Monday and marked the occasion by speaking with President Donald Trump about plans for human trips to Mars.
Whitson, 57, turned a zero-gravity summersault during the video call from the International Space Station, where she serves as station commander. She is midway through a planned 9-1/2-month mission.
By the time Whitson returns to Earth on Sept. 3, she will have racked up a career total 666 days in orbit. Only six Russian men have logged more time.
“What an amazing thing you’ve done,” said Trump, speaking from the Oval Office on his first call with an astronaut serving aboard the $100 billion orbital outpost.
“It’s a huge honor to break a record like this,” Whitson said with a beaming smile. “It’s an honor for me, basically, to be representing all the folks at NASA who make this spaceflight possible and who make me setting this record feasible.”
Whitson, a soft-spoken Iowa native, also holds the record for the most time spent spacewalking by a woman. In 2008, she became the first woman to command the space station about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.
She and newly arrived rookie crewmate Jack Fischer, 43, both spoke with the president, who was joined on the call by his daughter Ivanka Trump and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins.
Trump, who has proposed keeping the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s annual $19.5 billion budget roughly unchanged next fiscal year, asked about plans for human trips to Mars, tentatively to start in the 2030s.
“Well, we want to try to do that during my first term, or at worst during my second term, so we’ll have to speed that up a little bit, OK? ” Trump quipped.
“We’ll do our best,” Whitson said.
Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, grew up on a farm and enjoys gardening. She said she was inspired by the U.S. Apollo program that first brought man to the moon, but it was not until later, when the first women become astronauts, that she set her sights on joining them.
She joined the U.S. astronaut corps in 1996, becoming the space station’s first dedicated science officer six years later. Her current and third mission began on Nov. 17, 2016.
While she has surpassed the 534-day career record of U.S. astronaut Jeff Williams, Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka is the world record-holder with 878 days in orbit.
A banner flying behind her read: “Congrats Peggy!! New U.S. high-time space ninja.”

- NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson noted that water is a precious resource in space
- Trump made the joke during a video call to congratulate Whitson on setting a new record
Washington (CNN)During a video call with NASA astronauts Monday, President Donald Trump joked that he wouldn't want to re-use human urine as drinking water -- a practice common in US spaceflight.
Following an explanation by NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson of how human waste is repurposed for consumption, Trump responded that he would rather the space travelers drink it than himself.
Asked what the astronauts are ""learning up there in space,"" Whitson described to the President how those at the International Space Station are researching ways to re-use certain materials -- like human waste -- to create resources.
""Water is such a precious resource up here that we also are cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable,"" Whitson said. ""And it's really not as bad as it sounds.""
""I'm glad to hear that,"" Trump responded. ""Better you than me.""
The call was scheduled to congratulate Whitson on breaking the record for longest time spent in space by an American astronaut.

62,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21187671/nasa-space-launch-system-rocket-development-testing-shutdown-coronavirus,"NASA is shutting down production and testing of its future deep-space rocket and crew capsule in response to the worsening coronavirus pandemic. The two vehicles are critical pieces of NASA’s ambitious plan to return humans to the Moon by 2024, but with development temporarily suspended, meeting that deadline will become even more unlikely.
The shutdown comes amid NASA’s decision to heighten restrictions at two of the agency’s centers. The Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi are both moving to Stage 4 within NASA’s “Response Framework” for dealing with the pandemic, which is the strictest stage. That means telework is absolutely mandatory and all travel is suspended. The change was made after an employee at Stennis tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a blog post by NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. No one at Michoud has tested positive for the virus yet, but there is a rising number of cases near the center.
Both centers play critical roles in the development of NASA’s next big rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS. Cores of the rocket are primarily built at Michoud by NASA personnel and employees of Boeing, the vehicle’s main contractor. Meanwhile, the first completed core of the SLS is currently at Stennis, where it’s scheduled to undergo a significant ground test later this year. Called the Green Run Test, the exercise will ignite all of the engines on the rocket while it’s held down, simulating a launch without actually going to space. The test is meant to pave the way for the inaugural launch of the SLS, which is currently slated for 2021.
Now, with both centers restricting access, the production of new SLS cores and the work needed to prepare for the Green Run Test is coming to a halt. “The NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,” Bridenstine wrote in his update. “Once this is complete, personnel allowed onsite will be limited to those needed to protect life and critical infrastructure.” NASA is reassessing which personnel will be considered “mission critical” and allowed on site at each facility.
The shutdown is another blow for the SLS program, which suffered from delays and cost overruns long before the pandemic began. Originally slated for launch in 2017, the rocket’s first flight won’t happen until late next year at the earliest, and its first flight with crew on board is currently planned for either 2022 or 2023. The program’s budget has ballooned over the last decade as well, with the total development cost expected to reach $18.3 billion by the time rocket flies, according to a recent report from NASA’s Inspector General.
Despite all this trouble, the SLS is a key part of NASA’s Artemis program to land the first woman on the Moon. The vehicle’s third flight is meant to carry astronauts on that historic mission to the lunar surface. Given the 2024 deadline set by the Trump administration, there was already very little wiggle room with the current SLS schedule to meet that timeframe. A shutdown like this puts that goal in jeopardy — something NASA acknowledges.
“We realize there will be impacts to NASA missions, but as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the NASA workforce,” Bridenstine wrote.
The other critical piece of hardware needed for the Artemis program is the Orion crew capsule, which the astronauts will ride inside when launching on top of the SLS. The Orion capsule that will fly on the debut flight of the SLS just underwent testing in Ohio and is about to travel to Cape Canaveral, Florida, ahead of the launch next year. It now seems that once Orion makes it to Florida, work on that vehicle will shut down temporarily. Meanwhile, work on future Orion crew capsules will stop at Michoud.
With this latest move, three of NASA’s centers are at Stage 4, along with Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. The rest are at Stage 3, which allows mission-essential personnel to access NASA centers and travel. As the novel coronavirus situation worsens, it likely won’t be long until all of the centers move to Stage 4. It’s unclear how that will impact the rest of NASA’s activities, such as launches out of Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston maintains that its flight controllers can continue to operate the International Space Station even at Stage 4.
“I will continue to say, so none of us forget – there is no team better prepared for doing hard things,” Bridenstine wrote in his post. “Take care of yourself, your family, and your NASA team.”

By Katie Hope
Business reporter, BBC News
- Published
If you want to get a laugh out of a five-year-old, telling them that astronauts drink their own wee is bound to do the trick.
It's one of those fun facts that fascinates people about life in space.
Robyn Gatens, deputy division director for Nasa's International Space Station (ISS) programme, has seen plenty of negative reactions to the practice in her 30 years at the US space agency.
""It's a mental thing, it sounds yucky,"" she says.
The ISS recycles about 90% of all its water - as well as astronauts' urine, this includes their sweat, the moisture from their breath and their washing water.
""Yesterday's pee is this morning's coffee basically,"" is how British astronaut Tim Peake summed up the process.
A role model
It may sound unappetising, but the ability to reuse the same water over and over again has enabled people to stay in space longer without refuelling. Ultimately it could help astronauts become self sufficient on a planet such as Mars, a two-year trip Nasa says it is planning for the mid-2030s.
It is just one example of the many ways in which Nasa exploits limited resources. And it's exactly the kind of practice that makes the space agency a role model for those on earth trying to eliminate waste by reusing and repurposing things.
Nasa works with businesses on a lot of its research and has a Technology Transfer Program aimed at making sure its scientific know-how is applied on Earth as well as in space.
""We're working across industries, not just traditional space companies,"" says Ms Gatens.
US firm Water Security Corporation, for example, bought the rights to Nasa's water recycling tech and now uses a simpler version of it on earth.
The firm's filters are used to supply clean water in remote areas in countries such as Mexico and India, or disaster relief areas.
In Nasa's case, recycling almost all the water on the ISS has meant that since 2009 the space station has been able to host six astronauts, rather than three. This expansion has been ""critical"", says Ms Gatens, because it has enabled the crew to carry out more scientific research.
It's also saved a huge amount of money. Nasa last year estimated sending water to the space station, instead of reusing it, would have cost it more than $225m (£180m) due to the high cost of transporting such a heavy item.
But the space agency isn't stopping there. It's now working to recover even more water from the concentrated urine left behind by the current process. What's left after this will be solid waste that, Ms Gatens says, could potentially be used as radiation protection.
Nasa also recycles air on the ISS. Currently the space station's system recovers about half of the oxygen contained in the CO2 breathed out by the crew, a percentage it's actively trying to increase.
Start-up Skytree arose out of working on this technology. The firm's founders met at the European Space Agency (ESA) where they were working on recapturing CO2 to make longer space missions possible.
They secured funding from the ESA's technology transfer programme - which helps entrepreneurs starting businesses using space tech in a different field.
Now the firm is working with different companies on a variety of commercial uses for its technology, including using the CO2 captured to increase the yields derived from plant crops for purifying water and to create a clean domestic energy source.
""We hope to initiate a positive shift in people's perception: from CO2 as a potential problem to CO2 as an essential and incredibly versatile resource,"" Skytree says.
Just like in recent film The Martian where stranded astronaut Mark Watney grew potatoes, Nasa is also working on growing its own fresh vegetables in space. The project is aimed at eventually providing those on longer missions, such as to Mars, with a sustainable food source.
To grow the lettuce - eaten by US crew for the first time last year - Nasa used a collapsible unit packed with rooting ""pillows"", essentially mini grow bags, which contained the seeds, and coloured LED lights to enhance plant growth.
Similar farming systems where plants are stacked up on shelves to save space and grown from seeds are already common in Asia, and are beginning to become more popular in the US and UK.
Dr Gioia Massa, a Nasa scientist working on food production, says many of the lessons the space agency is learning could be applied in urban plant factories and other agriculture settings, with the potential to increase the amount of food grown in less space. Such skills will be vital as the world's population increases.
But sustainable solutions are not always hi-tech. Currently, space farers enviably never have to wash their clothes, but simply throw them away at the end of their usable life.
ISS crew are now testing exercise clothing, which has been treated with an antimicrobial compound, enabling them to be worn longer without smelling.
The other solution being considered is a simple ozone washing machine which, as Ms Gatens notes, nurseries often use to wash toys.
But in other areas of sustainability Nasa still has a long way to go. For example, as well as used clothing, astronauts still throw away things such as empty containers and the material used to cushion cargo from vibrations.
The items are stored in cargo resupply ships, which then burn up upon re-entry to Earth's atmosphere, incinerating everything.
The space agency is now considering making the cargo cushioning material out of 3D printer stock so that once in space, it can be used to create things such as tools.
Another option is heating and compacting its rubbish. After hiving off the additional water, the process creates big plastic dishes, which Ms Gatens likens to ""a huge coaster"". She says this could then be used as additional radiation protection, for example, in crew sleeping areas.
""The mindset is, with limited resources, whatever you can use, you want to be able to repurpose that,"" says Mary Hummerick, a Qinetiq North America microbiologist at Kennedy working on the project.",1
64,http://www.reuters.com/article/space-station-idUSL5E7KD2YN20110913,"MOSCOW, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it has postponed the next manned mission to the International Space Station until Nov. 12, more than a month later than initially planned over safety concerns following the crash of an unmanned cargo flight last month.
Three astronauts were forced to remain in space for an extra week and partners in the $100-billion station eyed leaving it unmanned for the first time in a decade after the Russian rocket failure on Aug. 24 sent the Progress cargo craft raining back to Earth in fiery bits.
Half of the current station crew -- NASA’s Ron Garan and cosmonauts Alexander Samokutyayev and Andrey Borisenko -- will land on the Kazakh steppes early on Friday, leaving a skeleton three person mission in orbit until their replacements arrive.
An investigation into the crash of Russia’s Soyuz rocket -- a model nearly identical to that used for manned space flights -- found a production fault that prevented fuel from reaching the gas generator caused the engine to fail in the upper-stages.
The next launch sending crew to the station will be the first since the U.S. space agency retired its 30-year shuttle programme in July, and the crash has increased concerns at NASA over relying entirely on Russian craft to send people to space.
Russia’s space agency also said it had scheduled a new Progress supply mission on October 30 to carry food and fuel to cosmonaut Sergei Volkov, astronaut Mike Fossum and Japan’s Satoshi Furukawa, who remain on board the orbital research station run by 16 nations.

BEIJING (AP) — A Chinese scientist who set off an ethical debate with claims that he had made the world’s first genetically edited babies was sentenced Monday to three years in prison because of his research, state media said.
He Jiankui, who was convicted of practicing medicine without a license, was also fined 3 million yuan ($430,000) by a court in the southern city of Shenzhen, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported. Two other researchers involved in the project received lesser sentences and fines.
The verdict said the three defendants had not obtained qualification as doctors, pursued fame and profits, deliberately violated Chinese regulations on scientific research, and crossed an ethical line in both scientific research and medicine, according to Xinhua. It also said they had fabricated ethical review documents.
The court also confirmed a third birth, saying the researchers were involved in the births of three gene-edited babies to two women. It said all three scientists pleaded guilty during the trial, which Xinhua reported was closed to the public because of privacy concerns.
He, the lead researcher, shocked the scientific world when he announced in November 2018 that he had altered the embryos of twin girls who had been born the same month. He described his work in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.
The announcement sparked a global debate over the ethics of gene editing. He said he had used a tool called CRISPR to try to disable a gene that allows the AIDS virus to enter a cell, in a bid to give the girls the ability to resist the infection. The identity of the children has not been released, and it isn’t clear if the experiment succeeded.
The CRISPR tool has been tested elsewhere in adults to treat diseases, but many in the scientific community denounced He’s work as medically unnecessary and unethical, because any genetic changes could be passed down to future generations. The U.S. forbids editing embryos except for lab research.
He, who is known as “JK,” told the AP in 2018 that he felt a strong responsibility to make an example, and that society would decide whether to allow the practice to go forward. He disappeared from public view shortly after he announced his research at a conference in Hong Kong 13 months ago, apparently detained by authorities, initially in an apartment in Shenzhen, a city in Guangdong province that borders Hong Kong.
It wasn’t clear if the three-year prison term includes any of the time he has already spent in Chinese custody.
A Chinese scientist said the sentence should have been harsher to deter others. Kehkooi Kee, a Tsinghua University researcher who conducts gene-editing research on stem cells, also said that He should be held responsible for any fallout from the experiment on the lives of the babies and their families.
Dr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford University bioethicist whose advice He sought for more than a year before his experiment, said he felt sorry for the scientist, his wife and two young daughters.
“I warned him things could end this way, but it was just too late,” Hurlbut wrote in an email addressed to the AP; the director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins; and gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna at the University of California, Berkeley.
“Sad story — everyone lost in this (JK, his family, his colleagues, and his country), but the one gain is that the world is awakened to the seriousness of our advancing genetic technologies,” Hurlbut wrote.
Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, noted it’s almost unheard of for a scientist to get imprisoned “but in this case the sheer recklessness and unethical behavior warranted it.” Topol praised China for standing up “for proper medical research conduct.”
Doudna told the AP she was concerned about the “mysterious” legal process in China, but she said the sentences are “a step toward bringing this case to closure” and send a strong message to discourage other such work. (Doudna is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports AP’s Health and Science Department.)
“As a scientist, one does not like to see scientists going to jail, but this was an unusual case,” Doudna said. He’s work was “clearly wrong in many ways.”
Before setting up a lab at the Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, He studied in the U.S. The verdict accused him of colluding with Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, who worked at medical institutes in the same province.
Zhang was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1 million yuan, Xinhua said. Qin received an 18-month prison sentence, but with a two-year reprieve, and a 500,000 yuan fine.

Court says Shenzhen-based He Jiankui ‘crossed the line’ with his work after women gave birth to gene-edited babies.
A court in China sentenced the scientist who created the world’s first “gene-edited” babies to three years in prison on Monday, having found him guilty on charges of illegally practising medicine.
He Jiankui, then an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said in November 2018 that he had used gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to change the genes of twin girls to protect them from getting infected with the AIDS virus in the future.
The backlash in China and around the world about the ethics of his research and work was swift and widespread. He was suspended from his job and accused of work that was “extremely abominable in nature”.
He and his collaborators forged ethical review materials and recruited men with AIDS who were part of a couple to carry out the gene-editing. His experiments ultimately resulted in two women giving birth to three gene-edited babies, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
The court also handed lesser sentences to Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, who worked at two unnamed medical institutions for having conspired with He in his work.
“The three accused did not have the proper certification to practice medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment,” the court said, according to Xinhua.

68,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/coronavirus-rattles-nasa-but-commercial-crew-and-mars-perseverance-rover-are-on-track/,"Most of NASA’s facilities around the country have been shut down, and while some teams can work (and drive a Mars rover) from home, others are knuckling down to get some crucial missions out the door — or face a half-billion-dollar late fee, said agency head Jim Bridenstine.
In an interview with the Planetary Society published today, Bridenstine discussed a variety of interesting topics, but none more immediately salient than the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on NASA’s work.
With projects tentatively scheduled for as long as a decade out, there’s plenty of wiggle room. But not every mission has that luxury, he explained, and the two that have been deemed truly essential — and therefore warranting NASA employees actually coming in to work — are the Commercial Crew program and the Mars Perseverance rover (formerly known as Mars 2020 and recently renamed in a very cute contest).
Commercial Crew has SpaceX and Boeing competing to provide an American-built alternative to the Soyuz spacecraft we’ve been using exclusively to send astronauts to the International Space Station since we retired the last Space Shuttle in 2011.
“That’s an essential function really for one reason. We have to make sure that we have access to the International Space Station, which is a $100 billion investment by the American taxpayer,” Bridenstine said. “So that mission is going forward.”
Going forward as early as next month, in fact, a date that has remained remarkably solid during a tough time for industries around the world, and in a program that has seen any number of speculative deadlines come and go.
Later in the interview he clarified that the Crew Dragon and Starliner capsules are not meant to be complete and permanent replacements for the Soyuz and Russian launch vehicles, but an alternative to make sure access is assured and the relationship to Russia isn’t one of dependency. Late last year a Soyuz failure nearly led to the ISS being empty for the first time ever, but quick work by investigators got things going again quickly. Having multiple vehicles ready to go would reduce the likelihood of that kind of crisis occurring.
The second mission that has been deemed essential is the next Mars rover, Perseverance.
“That’s mission essential for one reason and that is that we have a very limited launch window to go to Mars,” explained Bridenstine.
Unlike satellites going to orbit or even missions to the Moon, which have long and frequent launch windows, spacecraft going to Mars must be launched at times when our two planets are at very specific points in their orbit, in order to have shorter travel time and arrive precisely at the location planned. Interplanetary travel is a very exact science, and failing to get Perseverance out the door on time (July 17 in this case) would be disastrous.
“If we miss that launch window, it will cost us upwards of $500 million over the course of two years, if not wreck the mission altogether, which we do not want to have happen,” Bridenstine said.
He was careful to add that this would not be accomplished at the cost of NASA employees’ health:
They’re going to work with as many precautions as we can attain. We’re spreading the people apart. We’re putting people on different shifts, so they’re not at work at the same time. And then using PPE [personal protective equipment] when and where appropriate.
Look, if there’s anybody in the NASA workforce that doesn’t feel comfortable doing what they’re doing, we want them to say so and we want them to feel free to do something else. We wanna help them in fact do something else. We don’t want anybody to do anything that makes them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Our employees are the number one highest priority of the agency and we want everybody to feel safe in this very unique moment in time. And so we’re giving people a lot of latitude so that they feel safe and there will be no judgment on them at all.
As for projects that may face delays after all, Bridenstine admitted that the agency’s next-generation launch vehicle, the Space Launch System, or SLS, is in “a tough spot.” Its first test, Artemis I, is scheduled for the end of 2021, but may very well slip to 2022, he admitted. But he noted that Artemis II, the SLS’s second launch, is being prepared for independently and isn’t highly dependent on the timing of the first.
The ambitious plan to put boots on the Moon in 2024 was already considered something of a long shot, and the pandemic is making it look significantly longer. But at least in the short term, NASA’s truly critical operations are continuing and this spring and summer will, if all goes well (and let us hope it does), host successful and historic missions.

“All astronauts and cosmonauts have moved to the Russian sector of the ISS,” a representative of the Russian Space Agency’s Mission Control Centre told Interfax.
The crew put on breathing equipment and closed the hatch to the US segment during the move.
Maxim Matyushin, the head of the Russian centre, said the crew escaped harm as a result of their own “coordinated and efficient actions”, conducted in tandem with ground control in Moscow and Houston. Nasa would now analyse the state of the US section, he added.
The Russian Space Agency said the situation was under control and there was no threat to the health of the crew. “The concentration of impurities in the atmosphere of the Russian section is within acceptable norms,” it added.
Nasa said it may have been a false alarm triggered by a faulty sensor or a computer relay and there was “no direct evidence that ammonia was leaked into the station atmosphere”. All the crew were “safe and in good shape”.
The space station is currently manned by three Russians, two Americans and one astronaut from the European Space Agency. The commander is Nasa’s Barry “Butch” Wilmore.
On Monday, the SpaceX Dragon cargo carrier docked successfully with the ISS. The crew has been unloading several tons of supplies and equipment for science experiments.

70,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/nasa-spacex-to-launch-astronauts-in-may-despite-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"- NASA and SpaceX are moving forward with Demo-2, with the company planning to launch astronauts in late May despite the coronavirus crisis sweeping the nation.
- ""We need access to the International Space Station from the United States of America ... it's essential for our country to have that capability,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told CNBC.
- Bridenstine said that the agency is ""making sure that we're practicing all of our social distancing measures,"" with employees using personal protective equipment and working in rotating shifts.
This year began with NASA's goal of once again flying astronauts in sight, with partner SpaceX a few months away from launching its first crew.
Then coronavirus swept across the U.S.
NASA began locking down its centers last month in response to the mounting COVID-19 crisis, with over 245,000 cases in the U.S. A handful of NASA employees have tested positive for the virus and about half of the agency's centers are now at its most elevated response level, meaning all facilities are closed. Only employees working on programs deemed ""mission essential"" are continuing to come in, with a mandatory work from home policy in place for about 75% of NASA's workforce.
But despite the pandemic, the SpaceX ""Demo-2"" mission is moving forward.
As its name implies, Demo-2 will be the second time the company launches its Crew Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. But, unlike Demo-1 last year, this time two astronauts will be on board – a pair that will be the first NASA astronauts to launch from the U.S. since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.
""We need access to the International Space Station from the United States of America. Commercial Crew is the program that's going to make that happen. It's essential for our country to have that capability,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told CNBC. ""We are going to move forward.""
Bridenstine spoke from his home in Oklahoma as, like most of NASA, the agency's leader is working remotely. But even if he can't be there in person, Bridenstine is resolute in his support of getting Demo-2 off the ground. NASA announced on March 18 that the agency and SpaceX are planning Demo-2's launch for the latter half of May, as the mission was one of the few that NASA leadership deemed mission essential.
He said that NASA and SpaceX feel ""pretty confident"" that it will launch without a major delay, as ""we're working through the coronavirus pandemic."" He admitted that the rapidly evolving crisis means ""we don't know what the outcome is going to be"" but said that ""but if it gets delayed a little bit, we're going to be OK with that.""
""We're going to get it done,"" Bridenstine said.
NASA has awarded SpaceX more than $3.1 billion under the Commercial Crew program to fund development of the capsule, with the company also contributing hundreds of millions of dollars of its own funds when needed. Boeing is also developing its Starliner spacecraft to compete for contracts, with the company having received more than $4.8 billion in awards since Commercial Crew began.
There are about 350 NASA employees that work for the Commercial Crew program and Bridenstine said that the agency is ""making sure that we're practicing all of our social distancing measures."" Employees are using personal protective equipment when needed and are working in rotations.
""We're using shifts of workers in a way that we can enable more distancing,"" Bridenstine said.
'It's going to uplift America'
Bridenstine's additional impetus for charging forward with Demo-2 is that he believes it would be a morale boost for a nation battered by the crisis. Many states have fully shut down, with closing businesses
leading to unemployment for millions of Americans as state governments seek to counter the spread of coronavirus. To Bridenstine, launching astronauts would be a moment of hope among so much turmoil.
""It's going to uplift America. We need that moment right now in American history,"" Bridenstine said.
NASA has invited the press to apply for access to come to Florida to document the launch. But the invitation had an important caveat: ""NASA is proactively monitoring the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation as it evolves.""
While Bridenstine said the agency wants to host as many as it can to see the historic mission, NASA's medical officials may change or limit media access depending upon the crisis situation at the time of the launch. But Bridenstine said NASA is focused on leveraging its resources to broadcast the launch live, regardless of how many people are able to see it in person,
""We're going to showcase it,"" Bridenstine. ""We want to do as much as we can to reach every person in America and, in fact, every person in the world and we have the ability to do that with the technology that exists today""
The remaining milestones for Crew Dragon
NASA is analyzing ""two big things"" related to Crew Dragon before it signs off on SpaceX launching Demo-2, Bridenstine said: The spacecraft's parachute and emergency escape systems.
SpaceX is close to finishing tests for its new ""Mark 3"" parachute system. The company last year found a flaw in parachute designs used since the Apollo era and began redesigning the parachutes that will slow Crew Dragon before it splashes down in the ocean at the end of a mission.
SpaceX completed 24 tests of its new parachutes as of March 24, when the company had an issue during a drop test: The heavy parachute test device ""became unstable"" underneath a helicopter and was dropped before the parachutes could be armed to deploy, so the test didn't happen. Bridenstine noted that SpaceX plans to do two more parachute tests using a C-130 aircraft, instead of a helicopter, and he expects to see positive results.
""We feel really good about that so far,"" Bridenstine said of the parachutes.
The second milestone is final approval for changes SpaceX made to the capsule's emergency escape system last year. Crew Dragon has SuperDraco rocket engines on board — small but powerful motors that can accelerate the capsule away from the company's rocket in the event of an emergency. But during a test of those engines after Demo-1, an explosive chain reaction destroyed the spacecraft. SpaceX has been testing a fix to that system, including two successful demonstrations on the ground and in flight recently.
Bridenstine said the results of that fix ""look good,"" and SpaceX is nearly finished with additional tests in New Mexico at the White Sands Missile Range.
""We've done testing on that out at White Sands, that testing is all but complete at this point. Everybody feels very confident in that,"" Bridenstine said.
While not one of the two major remaining milestones, Bridenstine did also note that NASA is looking into data from a SpaceX launch of its Starlink satellites on Mar. 18. During the successful launch, one of the Falcon 9 rocket's engines shut down unexpectedly mid-flight – and, as Crew Dragon will launch on a Falcon 9 rocket, NASA wants to be sure the engine issue does not add any risk to its crewed mission. The agency joined SpaceX in its investigation of the early engine shutdown.
""We want to get a good understanding of what happened there,"" Bridenstine said.
NASA said its received the initial data analysis of the incident, with Bridenstine noting that the launch was the fifth time SpaceX had launched that particular rocket.
""We are using new engines for the Demo-2 launch,"" Bridenstine said. ""I don't think necessarily that [the engine issue] is going to be a showstopper.""
The organizations conducted a full simulation of Demo-2 in mid-March. SpaceX teams in Florida worked alongside NASA flight controllers in Texas while astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley were strapped into a simulator at the company's California HQ. The agency said the teams have completed ""a series of mission simulations from launch to landing"" over the past several months, with only a few more simulations and final crew training remaining.
NASA says its astronaut trainers ""are closely adhering to CDC recommendations on infection control,"" with a ""limited"" number of employees coming in contact with Behnken and Hurley.
""We always quarantine all of the astronauts before they go to the International Space Station ... now we're taking even more precautions,"" Bridenstine said.
Demo-2 will be 'two to three months' long
This mission is still technically considered a test flight, even though it will be the first time SpaceX flies astronauts to space. But the length of Demo-2 has been a key question, with NASA looking at extending it beyond the original plan of just a few days to the space station and back.
""Depending on when we launch they're going to be up there for probably two to three months,"" Bridenstine said.
Bridenstine explained that the plan is to bring Behnken and Hurley back a month before Crew-1, which the agency considers to be Crew Dragon's ""first operational"" flight. Crew-1 will mark the official start of SpaceX flying astronauts on regular missions to the ISS.
""We bring them back a month before we're ready to launch Crew-1 so we can take that month and investigate every part of the crew capsule,"" Bridenstine said. ""So the length of their stay on the ISS is going to be dependent on when the Crew Dragon is ready for Crew-1.""
He expects SpaceX will be ready with the next Crew Dragon capsule for Crew-1 to launch on time. Given the estimated schedule for Demo-2, the Crew-1 launch is targeting roughly August.
""We want to get into the regular crew launch schedule,"" Bridenstine said. ""We want to have as many crew as possible on the space station for as much time as possible, that's what we're trying to optimize.""
NASA this week unveiled the four astronauts that will fly on Crew-1. NASA assigned astronaut Shannon Walker to join previously announced astronauts Michael Hopkins and Victor Glover Jr., with Japan's space agency JAXA announcing that astronaut Soichi Noguchi would also be on the six month mission.
'We persevere'
When Demo-2 launches it will represent the turn of human spaceflight to the U.S., ending years of reliance on Russian spacecraft. Bridenstine said NASA is regularly talking to Vice President Mike Pence about Demo-2, as he hopes to host the country's executive leadership at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to see the launch in person.
""I would imagine that the White House is going to make a determination of who comes in the coming days,"" Bridenstine said.
SpaceX Demo-2 is one of two launches that Bridenstine says ""are going to stun the world"" in the coming months. The other launch is known as ""Mars 2020,"" a rover that NASA plans to launch in July. The agency last month unveiled that, after a nationwide student contest, the rover's name is Perseverance.
""That robot being named Perseverance is absolutely perfect because that's what we do as an agency, it's what we do as a nation,"" Bridenstine said. ""We persevere.""

- New spaceship Orion is ""go"" for test flight
- Launch is set for 7 a.m. ET Thursday
- Orion will orbit Earth twice and will splash down in the Pacific
It's the biggest countdown for NASA since the shuttle era ended in 2011. The space agency's new Orion spacecraft is scheduled to lift off on an uncrewed test flight at 7:05 a.m. ET Thursday from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
""We haven't had this feeling in awhile, since the end of the shuttle program,"" Mike Sarafin, Orion flight director at Johnson Space Center, said in a preflight briefing on Wednesday. He said it's the beginning of something new: exploring deep space.
Orion looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon: to an asteroid and eventually to Mars.
""It is, I think, consistent with those -- the beginning of shuttle and beginning of Apollo,"" said Mark Geyer, NASA Orion program manager. ""I think it's in the same category.""
When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days. Orion's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and Apollo was 12.8 feet in diameter, NASA said.
Orion is expected to take up its first crew in 2021.
During this test flight, Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and will orbit Earth twice. Four and half hours later, it will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California. Two U.S. Navy ships, the amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage and the Military Sealift Command rescue and salvage ship USNS Salvor, will help NASA recover the capsule.
NASA said there haven't been any major issues with the countdown. The vehicle is ""extremely clean"" and ""we're ready to go,"" said Geyer.
The weather forecast for liftoff also is good, with a 70% chance of acceptable launch conditions, according to Kathy Winters, a U.S. Air Force weather officer. ""It looks pretty promising weather-wise for launch,"" she said.
Winters said there may be some scattered clouds, but because the launch window will be open for two hours and 39 minutes, mission managers have some wiggle room if rain moves in. The temperature at launch time should be around 72 degrees Fahrenheit.
With mostly clear skies in the forecast, residents along Florida's east coast should be able to see the contrail from the huge Delta IV Heavy rocket that will carry Orion into orbit. The rocket is provided by United Launch Alliance, one of the private partners helping NASA with this launch. Eventually, NASA will use its own Space Launch System, which is under construction.
Once in orbit, Orion should send back some amazing pictures of Earth, NASA said. If the weather cooperates, NASA said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown.
Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty. It will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime-sized microchip.
""Sesame Street"" is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight, including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky.
Also going up: an oxygen hose from an Apollo 11 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil. A Tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the Denver Science Museum will be on board and lockers will be filled with flags, coins, patches, poetry and music.
In one more throwback to the Apollo-era, NASA veteran Gene Kranz will be a VIP in Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston when Orion is launched. Kranz was flight director for Apollo 11 during the first landing on the moon and he was flight director for the return of the Apollo 13 crew.
""I look forward very much to having him watch the team in action,"" Serafin said.",1
72,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/11/19/soyuz-spacecraft-makes-rare-night-landing.html,"Soyuz spacecraft returns astronauts to Earth in rare night landing
A Russian Soyuz space capsule made a rare nighttime landing in the frigid steppes of Kazakhstan early Monday, returning three astronauts to Earth after a four-month voyage to the International Space Station.
A timing glitch forced the capsule to overshoot its intended landing site slightly by a few miles, but made an otherwise smooth touch down at 7:56 a.m. local time — one hour before sunrise — on Monday, Nov. 19, NASA officials said. Because of time zone differences it was still Sunday night at NASA's space station Mission Control center in Houston.
""The crew is home,"" NASA spokesman Rob Navias said during landing commentary.
Returning home on the Soyuz were NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. The trio launched toward the station in mid-July and spent 127 days in space during their mission. [Soyuz Lands Safely with Station Crew (Photos)]
It was the first time in six years that a Soyuz spacecraft has landed at night, and only the fourth time in the 12-year history of Soyuz flights to the space station, Navias said. Some of the Soyuz's landing activities occurred a few seconds late, causing it to overshoot its landing site, but Russian recovery teams were able to compensate for the change during the descent, he added.
Weather at the landing site was overcast and freezing, with temperatures of 12 degrees Fahrenheit, though it felt like 0 degrees with the wind, Navias said. The Soyuz capsule landed on its side, a common configuration, and recovery teams were expected to work quickly to retrieve the astronauts due to the cold weather.
[pullquote]
Williams and her crew wore broad smiles after being extracted from their capsule. They sat in reclining seats under thick blankets to stay warm in the frigid cold before being moved to a inflatable medical tent for post-landing checks.
Williams, Malenchenko and Hoshide launched into orbit in mid-July, with Williams becoming the second female commander of the station when she took charge earlier this year. Williams, an avid runner, became ran the first triathlon in space during the mission, which also featured three spacewalks and the first official cargo delivery by a robotic Dragon spacecraft built by the U.S. company SpaceX.
Williams, who commanded the station's Expedition 33 mission, turned control of the outpost over to Ford on Saturday. The command change marked the start of the station's Expedition 34 mission by Ford and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin, who arrived at the station in late October.
""I think we've left this ship in good shape and I'm honored to hand it over to Kevin,"" Williams told Ford before presenting gifts to Expedition 34 crew in an emotional exchange. ""As you can see, we have a great crew up her, us who are going home very shortly and the ones who are taking over. The ship's in good hands.""
After the Soyuz returning the Expedition 33 crew to Earth undocked from the space station on Sunday, Ford radioed NASA's Mission Control center to say he was eager for his own mission. The Expedition 33 crew, he added ""kept the ship in ship shape.""
""It was a beautiful departure,"" Ford said of the Soyuz undocking. ""It was just beautiful to watch the ship fly away.""
Ford and his crew were able to watch a live video feed of NASA's coverage of the Soyuz landing. A camera on the space station's exterior also captured a dramatic view of the Soyuz capsule's super-hot plasma trail as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere.
The Expedition 32-33 mission marked the second spaceflight for Williams, who ended the expedition with 322 total days in space during her spaceflying career. That makes her the second most experienced female astronaut in history, behind NASA's Peggy Whitson (who spent 377 days in space during two station flights). [Most Extreme Human Spaceflight Records]
The mission was also the second spaceflight for Hoshide, who ended the flight with 141 days in space during his two space missions.
Malenchenko completed his fifth spaceflight during the Expedition 32-33 mission and ended the flight with a career total of 646 days in space, placing him seventh in the ranks of most experienced spaceflyers.
While Williams and her crew readapt to life on Earth, the Expedition 34 crew still on the space station will prepare for a busy holiday season in orbit. The astronaut and cosmonauts are expected to celebrate the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Nov. 22 and prepare for the arrival of three new crewmembers in mid-December.
A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko will launch to the space station on Dec. 19 from the Central Asian spaceport of Baikonur Cosmondrome in Kazakhstan.
The International Space Station is the largest manmade structure in space. It was built by five different space agencies representing the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada, with construction beginning in 1998. The $100 billion space station has been continuously occupied by a series of rotating astronaut crews since 2000.",1
73,http://www.reuters.com/article/space-landing-idUSL6N0C75A020130316,"ALMATY, March 16 (Reuters) - A Russian Soyuz capsule made a “bull’s eye” landing in the steppes of Kazakhstan on Saturday, delivering a Russian-American trio from the International Space Station, a day after its originally scheduled touchdown was delayed by foul weather.
NASA’s Kevin Ford and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin, who had manned the $100 billion orbital outpost since October as Expedition 34, landed in cloudy weather at 7:06 a.m. Moscow time (0306 GMT) northeast of the town of Arkalyk.
They had spent 144 days aboard the multinational ISS on their space journey of almost 61 million miles (98 million km).
“The landing was energetic and exciting,” Russian TV showed Novitskiy as saying.
NASA television said the deorbit burn and other events during the descent had gone flawlessly. It said the capsule had landed upright, almost hitting its bull’s eye target in thick fog.
“Oleg Novitskiy reported to search and recovery teams that the crew is feeling good,” NASA television said. “Everything seems to be in order.”
Due to hampered visibility, it took a few minutes before helicopters with Russian search and recovery teams could locate the Soyuz capsule after its landing.
The first images shown by Russia’s Vesti-24 television featured rescue workers standing in a snow-covered steppe opening the hatch of the capsule.
The three smiling astronauts were seated on semi-reclined chairs and covered with blue thermal blankets. They were then carried to a nearby inflatable medical tent.
On Friday, fog and freezing rain at the landing site in Kazakhstan prevented helicopters from setting up for the crew’s return to Earth.
In preparation for their departure, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield took the helm of the space station on Wednesday, becoming the first Canadian to take command of the outpost.
It is only the second time in the 12-year history of the station, a project of 15 nations that has been permanently staffed since November 2000, that command has been turned over to someone who is not American or Russian.
Hadfield will be part of a three-man skeleton crew until NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and cosmonauts Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin arrive later this month. (Reporting by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",1
74,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-station-hole/nasa-addresses-unexplained-space-station-hole-but-mystery-remains-unsolved-idUSKCN1ME08M?feedType=RSS&feedName;=scienceNews,"(Reuters) - NASA sought on Wednesday to tamp down speculation that sabotage caused a tiny hole found last month in the side of a Russian module docked at the International Space Station, but the mystery remained unsolved.
NASA stressed in a brief statement issued from its Washington headquarters that Dimitri Rogozin, general director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, had in public comments this week ruled out a manufacturing defect as the cause.
However, NASA added, “This conclusion does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent,” as some media outlets interpreted Rogozin’s remarks as suggesting.
Rather than giving greater credence to foul play, the elimination of a manufacturing defect as causing the hole “indicates that this is an isolated issue which does not categorically affect future production,” NASA said.
Roscosmos and NASA have each opened their own investigations of the 2 millimeter-wide hole detected in late August on the exterior wall of a Russian Soyuz capsule docked to the space station after ground operators reported slight dips in pressure levels.
The puncture has since been patched with tape and sealant, halting the oxygen leak, and officials said the current crew, consisting of three U.S. astronauts, two Russian cosmonauts and one German, were never in any danger.
Rogozin previously raised the possibility of a deliberate act in comments reported by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, which quoted him earlier this month as saying it appeared that a drill had been used by an “unsteady hand,” leaving metal around the hole scraped.
NASA declined to comment on those remarks at the time.
NASA spokeswoman Megan Powers said on Wednesday renewed media reports about the possibility of intentional damage to the Soyuz module stemmed from “rough translation” by some Western news outlets of Rogozin’s latest comments.
“No one is saying, and certainly NASA is not saying, that it was deliberate,” she said.
Powers said that, while intentional damage remains one of numerous possibilities still under review, “we’re not expecting it was a bad actor ... we don’t think that’s the most likely conclusion.”
She also said the space agency was confident that the origin of the hole would ultimately be explained. “We will find the reason and we will reveal the reason no matter what it is.”
NASA said a spacewalk was being tentatively planned for November to gather more information.
Another astronaut and cosmonaut are due to join the space station crew this month. They are slated for launch aboard a Russian Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft on Oct. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, NASA said.
NASA said its new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, was scheduled to attend the launch and would meet Rogozin there for the first time.

Even so, a traditional Kazakh felt hat and coat was possibly just not quite what US astronaut Kevin Ford, 52, had in mind after he and his Russian crewmates landed in the sub-zero temperatures of the Kazakh steppes on Saturday. A raging ice storm had delayed the crew's scheduled touchdown by 24 hours.

The retired US Air Force colonel, along with Evgeny Tarelkin, 38, and Oleg Novitskiy, 41, made a fiery re-entry through Earth's atmosphere squeezed into a Soyuz capsule, which reached its target north of the city of Arkalyk ""like a bullseye"", said Nasa, despite thick fog, snow, freezing rain and near-zero visibility in wintry Kazakhstan.
Two of the 12 search-and-rescue helicopters sent to locate and retrieve them were unable to land due to the extreme conditions.
""The landing was energetic and exciting,"" said Lt Col Novitskiy, the commander of the Soyuz. ""The crew were feeling good.""
The team were carried to helicopters on semi-reclined chairs, a measure adopted to help them adjust to Earth's gravity after four months in near-weightless conditions.
Since the retirement of Nasa's shuttle fleet in 2011, all space station crew members have travelled to and from the $100 billion laboratory, orbiting 220 miles above Earth, aboard Soyuz vehicles built and operated by the US space agency's Russian equivalent, Roscosmos.
America pays its former Cold War foe up to $45 million per astronaut for each round trip - an expense that it hopes ultimately to eliminate with the introduction of commercial space taxis now are under development by US firms including SpaceX, owned by the Paypal and Tesla Motors tycoon Elon Musk.
Cdr Ford's crew were involved in nearly 200 scientific research and technology projects aboard the ISS - more than any crew since the laboratory's construction was completed in mid-2011.
A new three-strong crew will take their place on the ISS later this month, joining the remaining two astronauts - from Canada and the US - and one cosmonaut currently on board. ""Seems a quite station with just us three,"" tweeted Nasa astronaut Thomas Marshburn, 52.",1

- Orion went father from Earth than any craft designed for human since 1972
- Valve problems scrubbed Orion test launch on Thursday
(CNN)With one 4½-hour flight Friday, the new spacecraft series that NASA hopes will take astronauts to Mars passed its first test above Earth.
NASA's Orion capsule -- part of America's bid to take crews beyond low-Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo missions -- splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Friday morning after lapping the planet twice on an uncrewed test flight.
The cone-shaped craft, slowed by a series of parachutes, settled onto the water at 8:29 a.m. PT (11:29 a.m. ET) about 600 miles southwest of San Diego.
""America has driven a golden spike as it crosses a bridge into the future,"" a NASA announcer said as the capsule bobbed on the ocean's surface during the agency's TV broadcast of the event.
The flight took Orion farther from Earth than any craft designed for human flight since the Apollo 17 mission to the moon in 1972 -- a confidence builder for a program that NASA hopes will take its first human crew into space in 2021.
""It appears that Orion and the Delta IV Heavy (rocket) were nearly flawless,"" program manager Mark Geyer told reporters.
Orion, a crew module designed to carry up to six astronauts, soared into the Florida sky at 7:05 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket. The assembly shed its boosters before the rocket's second stage lifted Orion into low-Earth orbit in minutes.
Two hours later, a milestone: The second stage lifted Orion higher for its second orbit, about 3,600 miles above Earth, or 15 times higher than the International Space Station.
""A human-rated system hasn't gone that far since 1972. ... That reminded us that here we are again, now, the United States leading exploration out into the solar system,"" Geyer said.
After the splashdown, crews from two Navy recovery ships were working to collect the craft.
It was a crucial test for the capsule: NASA wants to prove flight and re-entry abilities before it carries astronauts.
Beyond the moon
The Orion crew module, which looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but roomier, could take astronauts back to the moon, but also far beyond.
One of Orion's tasks might be to send astronauts to an asteroid -- perhaps one that NASA would first robotically redirect to orbit around the moon. NASA says it hopes that Orion, pushed by a more powerful rocket system under development, will send astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s.
NASA hopes Orion later will send astronauts to Mars' moons, and, eventually, to the Red Planet itself.
While NASA focuses on deeper space, private space companies such as SpaceX are expected to take over the space shuttles' old job of ferrying astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit.
When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space, or six astronauts for shorter missions.
By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days. Orion's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and Apollo was 12.8 feet in diameter, NASA said.
Data to sift
Friday's launch came a day after NASA scrubbed its first attempt because of a failure of some valves in the boosters to close. Those valves, which allow fuel to flow into the boosters before launch, are supposed to close just before liftoff.
Engineers and scientists will examine all sorts of data -- including those collected by on-board recorders -- to determine how well the capsule performed Friday. This includes how well the heat shield -- which keeps the capsule from burning up on re-entry -- held up.
""We know it worked,"" Geyer said, ""but the specifics of how well ... will take time to investigate.""
Though Orion's first flight didn't have people on it, it didn't go up empty. It carried the names of more than a million people packed on a dime-sized microchip.
""Sesame Street"" sent up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight, including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky.

- Published
The spectacle of satellites passing over the UK in what looks like a chain of lights should be visible for the rest of the week, space experts say.
The 60 Starlink satellites launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX firm appear in a line crossing the night sky.
They were launched into space in March but their current orbital position has made them easier to see in recent days.
Stargazers have been using apps and websites to check when they can spot the display.
SpaceX has sent 300 satellites into space so far towards a planned network of 12,000, with the aim of improving global internet coverage.
They have been taken up in batches of 60, with the most recent launch in mid-March.
The most recent line of satellites has been spotted in Derbyshire, Manchester, London, Leeds and across Europe, with many people sharing their excitement on social media.
The National Space Centre in Leicester said each batch was deployed to an orbit about 180 miles above Earth and had moved to about 340 miles away.
Sophie Allan, from the centre, said current good visibility was down to a combination of the batch's low orbit, clear night skies and the angle of the satellites in relation to the sun.
She said she expected this to continue for at least another five days.
Several websites and apps allow people to track the current locations of the satellites, with the next UK display expected shortly before 22:00 BST on Monday.
However, the project has been criticised by some astronomers who have branded the space technology an eyesore.",1
78,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-gene-editing-idUSKBN0TK4VA20151201?feedType=RSS&feedName=scienceNews,"(Reuters) - Scientists have developed an improved gene editing tool that significantly reduces potentially dangerous “off-target” edits, promising an even more precise and efficient system for manipulating human DNA.
Editing the genes of living organisms, including humans, holds out great promise for treating diseases. But it could also be used to create “designer babies”, prompting critics to call for a global ban on genetic modification of human embryos.
Tuesday’s news that U.S. researchers have re-engineered the so-called CRISPR-Cas9 system to slash editing errors comes as experts meet in Washington for a three-day summit to discuss the ethical and policy issues surrounding the field.
The technology allows scientists to edit genes by using biological “scissors” that operate a bit like a word-processing program that can find and replace defects.
The approach has excited academic researchers and drug companies alike, since it offers a way to rewrite the DNA of diseased cells, and the technology has been quickly put to work in laboratories around the world.
While CRISPR is highly effective and relatively simple to use, one major shortcoming is that it can cut additional sites on the genome that are not targeted, potentially causing undesired genetic effects. These could include cancer.
Now researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT believe they have found a way round the problem by tweaking three amino acids to reduce off-target editing cuts.
Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute and colleagues said they were making the new, improved system immediately available to researchers worldwide. Their findings were published online in a paper in the journal Science.
CRISPR has been put to work in a range of fields, including crop breeding and engineering mosquitoes that cannot spread malaria. But major ethical concerns were sparked in April when a team in China published details of an experiment to alter the DNA of human embryos.
While gene editing could, in theory, be used to stop a range of life-threatening genetic diseases being passed on to future generations, such “germline” modification would take medicine into a whole new area.
Opponents worry about unknown effects on future generations and the temptation for future parents to pay for genetic enhancements.
The question of how the revolutionary technology should be used is being tackled at the Dec. 1-3 international summit in Washington, convened by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, alongside Britain’s Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

- Orion will orbit Earth twice, and the spaceship will splash down in the Pacific
- To inspire students about spaceflight, ""Sesame Street"" is sending up some mementos
It looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but NASA's new spaceship is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon -- to an asteroid and eventually Mars.
Orion is scheduled to lift off on its first test flight at 7:05 a.m. ET Thursday from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch window will be open for two hours and 39 minutes.
Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and orbit Earth twice during the four and a half hour test run, NASA says. The spaceship will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California. Two U.S. Navy ships, the USS Anchorage and the USNS Salvor, will help NASA recover the capsule.
This first flight won't carry any astronauts, but it will move NASA closer to getting back in the crewed spaceflight business. The U.S. has had to pay Russia's space agency to launch astronauts to the space station since the space shuttle program ended in 2011.
Orion's crew module is designed to carry four people on a 21-day mission. But it could support six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo capsules held three astronauts and were out in space for about six to 12 days.
Orion will be launched on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket, the largest rocket available. NASA is building its own launch system for Orion.
Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty. It will carry up the names of more than million people packed on a dime-sized microchip.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.
An employee at NASA's Kennedy Space Center has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Fox News has confirmed.
A NASA spokesman said the agency received notification on March 22 that the person tested positive for COVID-19.
""This employee was last at the center more than 10 days ago,"" NASA spokesman Allard Beutel told Fox News via email. ""Based on the circumstances and elapsed time since the employee was on site, we believe it was acquired after the individual had started teleworking, and there is no additional risk at the center from this person.""
TOP CORONAVIRUS SCAMS TO BE AWARE OF
Beutel added KSC remains at Stage 3 with ""mandatory telework"" and is accessible by ""mission-essential personnel only,"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Located in Merritt Island, Fla., the Kennedy Space Center has been the primary launch center for NASA's human spaceflight for the past 50 years.
The news was initially reported by Florida Today.
Earlier this week, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told Fox News the space agency will ""continue to assess the potential impact on our missions as the situation unfolds.""
In an email to Fox News, Bridenstine said the agency's main priority is the safety of its workers – while noting the benefits of space exploration to the U.S. economy.
On March 19, Bridenstine announced the agency’s Michoud Assembly Facility and Stennis Space Center in New Orleans and Mississippi, respectively, would move to Stage 4, closing all facilities and forcing mandatory telework, putting the 2024 timeframe of a return to the moon in jeopardy.
NASA had recently moved the entire agency to Stage 3, which still allowed for ""mission essential personnel"" to appear at the centers. The decision to change Stennis's status was made ""due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the community around the center, the number of self-isolation cases within our workforce there, and one confirmed case among our Stennis team,"" Bridenstine said last week.
Separately, NASA issued a statement on its website on March 20 that its Perseverance rover is a ""high priority"" for the agency, noting the mission will continue as is.
""Much of the work is being done by employees and contractors who work remotely across the agency. Assessments by agency leadership are underway for anyone required to work in areas under restriction, such as NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., especially after the recent announcement by California’s governor,"" NASA wrote in the statement issued late Friday.
However, the fate of the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope, slated to launch in March 2021, is up in the air. The government agency also said it would suspend ""integration and testing operations"" to ensure ""the safety of the workforce."" The James Webb Telescope is the planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in operation for more than 29 years.

On March 14, the European Space Agency, in conjunction with Russian space agency Roscosmos, announced that its next mission to Mars will be delayed until 2022 due in part to the coronavirus pandemic.

81,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/12/04/nasa-set-to-launch-much-anticipated-orion-spacecraft.html,"NASA set to launch much anticipated Orion spacecraft
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – With the imminent debut of its Orion spacecraft, NASA is on a high not felt since the space shuttle days.
Shuttle veterans, in fact, are leading the charge in Thursday morning's two-orbit, 4½-hour test flight, meant to shake out the capsule before astronauts climb aboard — eventually, perhaps, to visit Mars.
""We haven't had this feeling in a while, since the end of the shuttle program,"" said Mike Sarafin, the lead flight director stationed at Mission Control in Houston. ""Launching an American spacecraft from American soil and beginning something new, in this case exploring deep space.""
Orion is set to fly farther than any human-rated spacecraft since the Apollo moon program, aiming for a distance of 3,600 miles, more than 14 times higher than the International Space Station.
That peak altitude will provide the necessary momentum for a 20,000-mph, 4,000-degree entry over the Pacific. Those 11 short minutes to splashdown is what NASA calls the ""trial by fire,"" arguably the most critical part of the entire test flight. The heat shield at Orion's base, at 16.5 feet across, is the largest of its kind ever built.
Navy ships were stationed near the recovery zone off the Mexican Baja coast.
""It's an exciting time,"" Jeff Angermeier, ground support mission manager, said from Florida's Kennedy Space Center. ""You can feel the buzz.""
An estimated 26,000 guests were expected to jam Kennedy for the sunrise launch, as well as 650 journalists. (Actually, the unmanned rocket will blast off from the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.) The space center press site was packed Wednesday with out-of-town reporters not seen here since the last shuttle flight in 2011.
NASA's Orion program manager, Mark Geyer, puts the capsule's inaugural run on a par with the formative steps of Apollo and the space shuttles.
""In the sense that we are beginning a new mission, it is, I think, consistent with ... the beginning of shuttle, the beginning of Apollo,"" Geyer said. ""It's a new mission for us, starting in the region of the moon and then beyond.""
Noted NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr.: ""For the first time in more than 40 years, this nation is going to launch a spacecraft intended to carry humans beyond low-Earth orbit. That's a big deal.""
Unlike the first space shuttle flight in 1981 — helmed by two pilots — Orion will not carry astronauts before 2021.
NASA wants to test the most critical parts of the capsule on this $370 million shakedown cruise, including the heat shield, parachutes and all the sections jettisoned during ascent and entry. The capsule also will travel through the high-radiation Van Allen belts surrounding Earth; engineers want to gauge the effects on the on-board computers.
A Delta IV rocket is hoisting Orion this time around. For Orion's next flight, around 2018, the capsule will fly atop the megarocket still in development by NASA — SLS, short for Space Launch System. Only after that will humans climb aboard; NASA hopes to send an Orion crew to an asteroid corralled in lunar orbit in the 2020s and to Mars in the 2030s.
Flying this one without humans on board took some of the edge off NASA's first-flight jitters.
Still fresh in everyone's minds is October's explosion moments after liftoff of a commercial rocket carrying supplies for the International Space Station. No one was on board that flight, either, and no one on the ground was hurt.
""It's important it's unmanned because we actually structured the test to fly the riskiest pieces of the flight,"" Geyer told reporters. ""This is the time to do it, when it's unmanned, and so we intend to stress the systems and make sure they behave as we designed them.""
Lockheed Martin Corp. is handling the test flight for NASA, much the way NASA has contracted out the development of two manned capsules meant for space station ferry trips.
Even so, the shuttle ties run deep.
Sarafin's entire team at Johnson Space Center in Houston is comprised of former shuttle flight controllers. A special VIP, on hand in Mission Control on Thursday, will be Gene Kranz, the legendary flight director of Apollo 11 and 13 fame, and more.
The mission director for Thursday's flight, based at Kennedy, is Lockheed Martin's Bryan Austin, a former shuttle flight director like Sarafin.
Kennedy's director, Robert Cabana, is a former shuttle commander. So is Bolden, NASA's top guy.
""Getting the band back together,"" Sarafin said.",1

Gene editing should only be used to prevent suffering, international group of scientists asserts
By Barry Eitel
SAN FRANCISCO
Genetically engineered babies should be allowed in the future when the technology becomes available, according to a report released by a committee comprised of 21 leading scientists.
However, human gene editing must be restricted to only preventing diseases or disabilities in babies, the panel argued. The policy group behind the 261 page report published Tuesday was put together by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine.
Essentially, the group contends that gene-editing using new technologies could be allowed in human embryos, eggs and sperm, but not to create “designer” children.
“Human genome editing holds tremendous promise for understanding, treating, or preventing many devastating genetic diseases, and for improving treatment of many other illnesses,” Alta Charo, co-chair of the study committee and a bioethicist at University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement.
“However, genome editing to enhance traits or abilities beyond ordinary health raises concerns about whether the benefits can outweigh the risks, and about fairness if available only to some people.""
Regulations on studying gene editing need to be especially stringent for changes to “germline” genes, i.e. genes that are inherited from parents to children. Studies of multiple generations would have to be conducted in order to fully understand the implications of editing germline genes.
A global prohibition on human gene editing is not practical, the scientists concede, when access to CRISPR gene editing tools have become so cheap in the past two years. Scientists in China, for example, are already using the technology on human cells.
“Genome editing research is very much an international endeavor, and all nations should ensure that any potential clinical applications reflect societal values and be subject to appropriate oversight and regulation,"" said committee co-chairs Richard Hynes, of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Daniel K. Ludwig, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a joint statement.
""These overarching principles and the responsibilities that flow from them should be reflected in each nation's scientific community and regulatory processes.”Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
""For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,"" He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.
""This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,"" He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.
However, he said the trial has now been paused in the wake of the outcry.
""I must apologise this result was leaked unexpectedly,"" said He. ""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation,"" he added.
He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
A total of eight volunteer couples – HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers – had signed up to the trial, with one dropping out before it was halted.
The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organisers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.
A leader of the international conference on gene editing said He's work showed a failure of self-regulation among scientists.
Nobel laureate David Baltimore said the work would ""be considered irresponsible"" because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered.
Baltimore said he didn't think that was medically necessary. He said the case showed ""there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community"" and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. ""Pandora's box has been opened,"" they said.
He's research focuses on genome sequencing technology, bioinformatics and genome editing, according to his biography on the summit's website.
He received his PhD at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in Stephen Quake lab at Stanford University according to the site.",0

But NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Drew Morgan, along with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka, returned Friday morning to a world that's drastically different today than what it was when they left for the International Space Station months earlier.
The trio made a parachute-assisted landing in a Soyuz capsule that touched down in a remote part of Kazakhstan, where they were greeted by crews wearing face masks.
Total social distancing is pretty much impossible when returning to Earth from orbit, as each space traveler is pulled one-by-one from the capsule by four men who carry them to a chair where they enjoy a first breath of fresh air in months and go through a series of medical checks.
NASA TV broadcast the entire process, and it's bittersweet to see the astronauts welcomed home, sitting and enjoying their first bit of sunshine in 2020 as members of the recovery crew ask all non-medical staff to keep a safe distance while the checks are done.
Russian officials said the crew that met the astronauts had been tested and monitored for nearly a month beforehand to make sure they weren't carrying the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Cases of coronavirus have been reported at Star City, where astronauts and cosmonauts train, and Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has recorded 30 cases among its ranks, according to the AP.
Morgan's nine-month mission began July 20, while Meir and Skripochka have been in space since Sept. 25. They're among the rare minority of humans we can be absolutely sure had no exposure to the coronavirus -- at least until three new colleagues arrived at the space station last week.
The trio said in interviews from the space station before returning that they had been keeping tabs on the pandemic news.
""It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,"" Meir said.
During her time in orbit, Meir conducted three historic all-female spacewalks with fellow astronaut Christina Koch. Morgan also participated in seven space walks during his nine-month mission.
While getting their vitals checked, the returned Earthlings had a chance to call their families before taking a helicopter back to the Baikonur cosmodrome, where the three will split up and Meir and Morgan will take a NASA flight home to Houston.
The next flight to the space station will also be historic. NASA and SpaceX are set to send astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS aboard a Crew Dragon launching from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on May 27. This will be the first time humans have traveled to space from US soil since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.

The agency have moved their employees to teleworking, amid the pandemic
Nasa will enact stricter protocols in time for returning astronauts Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir, amid the coronavirus pandemic.
CNN reports that the agency will closely adhere to CDC guidelines when the two astronauts come back to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) on 17 April.
Communications specialist at Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre, Courtney Beasley told CNN that the checks are already rigorous but will ramp up in light of Covid-19.
“Nasa will closely adhere to the CDC’s recommendations on infection control for the coronavirus as Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir return to Earth and begin their post-flight medical testing and re-adaptation period,” she said.
“This includes cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasising hand hygiene, encouraging Nasa team members who are sick to stay home and limiting contact with the crew members.”
Nasa are gearing up for a launch to the ISS on 9 April and although the astronauts will be quarantined, Ms Beasley insists that this is standard for the agency prior to launch.
“All of our crew must stay in quarantine for two weeks before they launch. This ensures that they aren’t sick or incubating an illness when they get to the space station and is called health stabilisation,” she said.
On Tuesday, the agency published a press release from Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, confirming staff will be working from home for the foreseeable future.
“Nasa’s early and thoughtful actions in coordination with our country’s unified response to this health emergency is an incredible display of national solidarity,” said Mr Bridenstine.
“Thank you for your vigilance and flexibility. I am confident your diligence and commitment will ensure our mission will continue. Please make certain you are giving the appropriate attention to your health and that of your family.”
According to a tracking project hosted by Johns Hopkins University, upwards of 14,000 people have tested positive in the US. The death toll has reached at least 210.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended a two-week ban on gatherings of more than 50 people as part of the battle to contain the spread of the contagion.

86,https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-uncrewed-flight-035452454.html,"Boeing will conduct another unmanned test flight to demonstrate the Starliner spacecraft after its first attempt failed to reach the ISS. According to The Washington Post, the repeat flight will take place in October or November, which means the aerospace corporation likely won’t be able to launch a crewed flight this year. SpaceX, on the other hand, recently assured NASA and space fans that it will still conduct its first manned flight in May. If everything goes according to plan, the newer company will be ferrying astronauts to the ISS before Boeing can.
In a statement about the repeat flight, Boeing said:
“The Boeing Company is honored to be a provider for the Commercial Crew mission. We are committed to the safety of the men and women who design, build and ultimately will fly on the Starliner just as we have on every crewed mission to space. We have chosen to refly our Orbital Flight Test to demonstrate the quality of the Starliner system. Flying another uncrewed flight will allow us to complete all flight test objectives and evaluate the performance of the second Starliner vehicle at no cost to the taxpayer. We will then proceed to the tremendous responsibility and privilege of flying astronauts to the International Space Station.”
The Starliner was supposed to dock with the International Space Station in December, but it didn’t reach the correct orbit. A team from NASA and Boeing later investigated the incident and found flaws in the latter’s testing procedure that caused the failure.
Apparently, the aerospace giant divided its tests in small chunks instead of conducting longer ones that simulate the whole process from launch to docking. Because of that, the company didn’t realize that the spacecraft’s onboard computer time was miscalibrated by 11 hours, preventing its thrusters from firing at the right time. Further, the team found a critical software defect that could’ve led to the loss of the spacecraft.
Boeing has to ensure that the Starliner can safely reach the space station before it can fly with a crew onboard. NASA told The Post in a statement that it “has accepted the proposal to fly the mission again and will work side-by-side with Boeing to resume flight tests.”",1
87,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/IghoCR_KKgY/index.html,"(CNN)For the first time since the final space shuttle mission in 2011, astronauts will launch into space aboard an American rocket and spacecraft from American soil, according to NASA.
The agency, along with SpaceX, is eyeing a mid-to-late May launch for the manned SpaceX Demo-2 flight test from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Since the last shuttle mission in July 2011, crews launching to the International Space Station have been conducted from Baikonur in Russia aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
The agency is monitoring CDC guidance with regards to mission planning amid the coronavirus pandemic, they said. The launch date could be postponed. All NASA centers are currently operating with non-mission-essential work occurring remotely, which limits employee contact with the crew, according to the agency.
But for now, things are going according to plan. NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are expected to be on the May flight test in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on top of a Falcon 9 rocket. It is the final flight test of the system before SpaceX is certified to carry out operational crew flights to and from the space station for NASA, the agency said.
Hurley and Behnken have been practicing in a Crew Dragon simulator over the last few months. Flight control teams for NASA and SpaceX in Florida, Texas and California have also been simulating different aspects of the mission to practice ahead of the Demo-2 launch.
In March, the simulations closely mirrored the mission itself, simulating timelines that began with pre-launch procedures and continued all the way to docking with the space station. They also simulated leaving the space station and splashing down back to Earth.
""The simulations were a great opportunity to practice procedures and to coordinate decision-making for the mission management team, especially with respect to weather,"" said Michael Hess, manager of Operations Integration for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. ""Simulation supervisors do a great job at picking cases that really make the team think and discuss.""
The Crew Dragon spacecraft is also being prepped for pre-launch and going through the final tests at the SpaceX facility near Cape Canaveral in Florida.
This leads to ""more simulations, final crew training and flight readiness reviews to ensure all of the mission systems and subsystems are ready for a crewed test flight,"" Hess said.
Commercial partners like SpaceX are opening up access to low-Earth orbit, like the space station.
""What's happening in commercial crew is a big deal,"" Hess said. ""This new spacecraft, Crew Dragon, was designed and built by SpaceX, not by NASA and traditional contractor partnerships. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will definitely be earning their spacecraft test pilot wings with this mission.

Demo-2 is the final test before NASA transitions to operational crewed flights to the space station using the Crew Dragon spacecraft.
The first mission, slated for launch later this year if Demo-2 is successful, will send NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Shannon Walker and Victor Glover Jr., as well as Soichi Noguchi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, up for a six-month stint on the space station.
It will be the second spaceflight for Walker and Hopkins, who have both been on the space station before, and the first for Glover. It's Noguchi's third spaceflight; he was formerly a space shuttle and space station crew member.",1

- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
- Christopher CassidyFormer Commander of the International Space Station
Almaty (Kazakhstan) (AFP) - A three-man crew docked successfully at the International Space Station Thursday, leaving behind a planet overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Russian space agency Roscosmos said the Soyuz MS-16 capsule ""docked successfully"" in a statement on its website.
Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of Roscosmos and NASA's Chris Cassidy reached the ISS at 1413 GMT, just over six hours after blasting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where COVID-19 caused changes to pre-launch protocol.
Usually the departing crew faces questions from a large press pack before being waved off by family and friends.
Neither was possible this time round because of travel restrictions imposed over the virus, although the crew did respond to emailed questions from journalists in a Wednesday press conference.
Cassidy, 50, admitted the crew had been affected by their families not being unable to be in Baikonur, Russia's space hub in neighbouring Kazakhstan, for their blastoff to the ISS.
""But we understand that the whole world is also impacted by the same crisis,"" Cassidy said.
Astronauts routinely go into quarantine ahead of space missions and give a final press conference at Baikonur from behind a glass wall to protect them from infection.
That process began even earlier than usual last month as the trio and their reserve crew hunkered down in Russia's Star City training centre outside Moscow, eschewing traditional pre-launch rituals and visits to the capital.
The next crew to return to Earth from the ISS will be flying to their home countries on April 17 via Baikonur, rather than Karaganda in central Kazakhstan as usual, as part of new travel measures related to the pandemic.
- Tips on self-isolation -
The ISS typically carries up to six people at a time and has a livable space of 388 cubic metres (13,700 cubic feet) -- larger than a six-bedroom house according to NASA.
Those dimensions will sound enviable to many residents of Earth, more than half of whom are on various forms of lockdown as governments respond to COVID-19 with drastic measures.
In recent weeks, astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS and on Earth have been sharing tips on coping with self-isolation.
In a piece for the New York Times last month, NASA's Scott Kelly said his biggest miss during almost a year in space was nature -- ""the colour green, the smell of fresh dirt, and the feel of warm sun on my face"".
During his time aboard the ISS he ""binge-watched 'Game of Thrones' -- twice"" and enjoyed frequent movie nights with crewmates, he wrote.
Two-time cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy has become the face of a 10-week challenge that will see participants post videos of themselves completing physical exercises as part of a competition aimed at both youth and adults.
The initiative that Roscosmos is backing aims ""to support people in a situation of isolation, instil a healthy lifestyle and thoughts through regular sports, without going out in public places"", Ryazanskiy said in a video promoting the ""Cosmos Training"" challenge.
The launch of Ivanishin, Vagner and Cassidy marks the first time a manned mission has used a Soyuz-2.1a booster to reach orbit, after Roscosmos stopped using the Soyuz-FG rocket last year.
The newer boosters have been used in unmanned launches since 2004.
The upgraded rocket relies on a digital flight control system rather than the analogue equipment used in prior Soyuz models.
Russia and Baikonur have enjoyed a near decade-long monopoly on manned missions to the ISS since NASA wound up its Space Shuttle program in 2011.
But that may change as early as next month when Elon Musk's SpaceX could be ready to launch a two-man crew to the orbital lab, NASA said in March.
NASA said that the tech entrepreneur's company and the space agency are targeting ""mid-to-late May"" for a test launch that will transport NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS in SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule.
The International Space Station -- a rare example of cooperation between Russia and the West -- has been orbiting Earth at about 28,000 kilometres per hour (17,000 miles per hour) since 1998.",1

“Everyone feels extremely well,” he said. “We adapted very quickly. We were not ill at all.”
The young Frenchman landed at the ISS last Saturday alongside NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. They joined three men already on board – one American and two Russians.
It is Pesquet’s first space flight and the first French space mission in eight years.
“During Proxima, Thomas will perform around 50 scientific experiments for ESA (European Space Agency) and France’s space agency CNES as well as take part in many research activities for the other Station partners,” the European Space Agency said.
In addition to English, Spanish and German, Thomas Pesquet has also spent many hours learning Russian so he can communicate with the cosmonauts. “It’s probably the most difficult thing I’ve done in the last few years, but we are going to have to use it almost on a daily basis in the Russian vehicle,” he told FRANCE 24 in a recent interview at the ESA’s headquarters in Paris.
Pesquet has recounted how he was a “space fanatic” as a child growing up in the northern French city of Rouen. In his family home he would play in a cardboard ""space shuttle"" built by his father, and begged his parents to buy magazines that specialised in space exploration. He said he made career choices that almost “unconsciously” led him to become an astronaut.
After getting a degree in spacecraft design and control, he started his career as a satellite and spacecraft engineer. He was later selected by Air France’s flight training programme and became an airline pilot. In May 2009 he was chosen to be an ESA astronaut – one of only six picked from a list of 8,413 candidates.
""Thomas is a remarkable guy,"" former ESA chief Jean-Jacques Dordain told AFP in a recent interview, recounting how he helped pick Pesquet when the pool of candidates had been reduced down to just 10 people.
""He boasts both an interesting professional curriculum and important social attributes that allow him to be comfortable with everyone around him. And finally, he is passionate,” Dordain said. “That makes him a great ambassador for space.""

The U.S. will pay Russia $70.7 million for a single shuttle ride aboard the country’s Soyuz rocket Tuesday night, even as President Barack Obama fights for sanctions and penalties against Russia for its recent invasion of the Ukraine.
With politicians wrangling over the most diplomatic way to respond to Russia’s aggression, NASA said the space pay-off to the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) wouldn’t be affected by politics.
“We do not expect the current Russia-Ukraine situation to have an impact on our longstanding civil space cooperation with Russia, which goes back decades, including our partnership on the International Space Station (ISS) program,” Trent Perrotto, a spokesman for the space agency, told FoxNews.com.
“We are confident that our two space agencies will continue to work closely as they have throughout various ups and downs of the broader U.S.-Russia relationship.”

NASA astronaut Steve Swanson will join Russian cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev aboard a Soyuz rocket set to blast off from a launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 5:17 p.m. EDT Tuesday night (early Wednesday morning in Russia).
Because the U.S. doesn’t presently have its own way to get astronauts into space, it relies upon Russian rockets to do so. Last April, NASA signed a new agreement with Russia governing six flights through 2017, at a cost of $70.7 million per seat. At the time, NASA administrator Charles Bolden blamed Congress for failing to fund a replacement ride.
“If NASA had received the President’s requested funding for this plan, we would not have been forced to recently sign a new contract with Roscosmos for Soyuz transportation flights,” he wrote in a NASA blog.
NASA told FoxNews.com on Monday that it continues to pursue ways to bring spaceflight back to U.S. soil, hopefully within the next three years.
“NASA is working aggressively to return human spaceflight launch to American soil and end our sole reliance on Russia to get into space. Later this year, NASA intends to select the American companies that will transport its astronauts to the space station beginning in 2017. In the meantime, NASA and Roscosmos will continue to work with each other to maintain the space station, where humans have lived continuously for more than 13 years.”
Swanson, Skvortsov and Artemyev -- officially named Expedition 39 -- will take an express, 6-hour journey to the station. The TMA-12M spacecraft they will helm was rolled out by train to the launch pad on Sunday, March 23.
The trio will remain aboard the station until mid-September, NASA said, and will join Japan’s Koichi Wakata, U.S. astronaut Rick Mastracchio and Russian Mikhail Tyurin, who have been aboard the orbital outpost since November.
Aboard the orbiting complex Friday, Wakata, Mastracchio and Tyurin tackled a range of scientific experiments and performed some routine maintenance and cleaning to get the station shipshape for the arrival of their three new crewmates, NASA said.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, the Pentagon said it would take a long, hard look at the connections between the two countries when it comes to space technology. Notably, rocket engines from Russian company NPO Energomash are used by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of U.S. firms Lockheed Martin and Boeing, to power Atlas V rockets -- which the Air Force relies upon for satellite launches.
At a congressional hearing on Thursday, March 13, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the rocket motor issue would definitely need to be examined, according to Reuters.
""I think this is going to engage us in a review of that issue. I don't think there's any question about that,"" Hagel said.",1

But one of the men at the forefront in that giant leap for mankind believes that the time has come for the US to start taking significant steps towards conquering the Red Planet.
Speaking at a conference of space experts in Washington DC on Wednesday, Buzz Aldrin, the American astronaut who was the second man to walk on the Moon, urged the US and NASA to dedicate resources towards not just to sending people to Mars, but building a permanent colony on the planet.
""The US needs to begin homesteading and settlement of Mars,"" the 83-year-old said at the Humans to Mars conference at George Washington University. ""It is within reach.""
'Very little new research required'
According to Aldrin, most of the technology needed to send people to Mars already exists, with cash investment and political will the only barriers to such a mission.
""There is really very little new research that is required,"" Aldrin said.
Once humans have reached Mars, establishing a permanent settlement on the planet should be the goal, said the former astronaut.
""We are talking about multiple missions to eventually settle and colonise Mars,"" said Aldrin.
""We should focus our attention on establishing a permanent human presence on Mars by the 2030-2040 decade.
""The United States will be a beacon for the development of humanity.”
Man on Mars by 2030
Although Aldrin’s advocacy for a Mars colony may sound ambitious, NASA itself believes a manned mission to the planet is well within reach.
The organisation and US President Barack Obama have outlined plans to launch the first such mission by 2030.
Speaking at the start of the start of the Humans to Mars conference on Monday, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said that despite hard economic times the United States is committed to breaking new boundaries in space exploration.
""A human mission to Mars is today the ultimate destination in our solar system for humanity, and it is a priority for NASA. Our entire exploration program is aligned to support this goal,"" Bolden said.
However, unlike Aldrin, he acknowledged that there are “technological gaps” that must be overcome before a manned mission to Mars can go ahead.
""And so every single moment of our time and every single dollar of our assets must be dedicated to developing those technologies that allow us to go beyond low Earth orbit, beyond the Moon,"" said Bolden.

HONG KONG — A Chinese scientist who claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies “seriously violated” state regulations, according to the results of an initial government investigation reported on Monday by Chinese state media.
The investigators’ findings indicate that the scientist, He Jiankui, and his collaborators are likely to face criminal charges.
Dr. He shocked the world in November when he announced that he had used Crispr, a powerful gene-editing technique, to alter the genes of human embryos. He produced some data but no definitive proof during his presentation at an international conference in Hong Kong.
The investigation found that Dr. He and his team had edited the genes of human embryos and then implanted the embryos in female volunteers, as he claimed last year. One volunteer gave birth to twin girls in November, and another volunteer is now pregnant, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency.
Dr. He’s announcement raised ethical concerns about the long-term effects of such genetic alterations, which if successful would be inherited by the child’s progeny, and whether other scientists would be emboldened to try their own gene-editing experiments.
Scientists inside and outside China criticized Dr. He’s work, which highlighted fears that the country has overlooked ethical issues in the pursuit of scientific achievement. The Chinese authorities placed Dr. He under investigation, during which time he has been kept under guard at a guesthouse at the Southern University of Science and Technology in the city of Shenzhen.
The university announced on Monday that it was rescinding Dr. He’s contract and canceling all of his teaching and research activities there.
In countries including the United States, such a clinical trial would be banned. But China has laxer regulations on such research, and it was not immediately clear which specific laws Dr. He was accused of breaking.
This case has served as a warning that China needs to enact tough laws on gene editing, said Wang Yue, a professor at Peking University who researches health law in China.
“Even though the Ministry of Health has issued ethical rules, the legal responsibility is unclear and the penalties are very light,” he said.
The government investigation found that starting in 2016, Dr. He had deliberately evaded supervision, used unsafe and ineffective methods, and forged ethical review materials, Xinhua reported.
“This behavior seriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations causing adverse effects at home and abroad,” Xinhua said.
Dr. He and other personnel and institutions involved “will be dealt with seriously according to the law,” the report said, citing an unidentified lead investigator. The case will be handed over to public security organs, the report said, indicating the likelihood of criminal charges.
The investigation also found that Dr. He had raised funds on his own “in pursuit of personal fame and fortune.” The allegations that he forged documents and financed his work independently could shield from punishment his university, the local authorities and the hospital where the trial was carried out.
Still, some critics have asked how Dr. He could have perpetrated such a scheme without some knowledge of the authorities. After his announcement, speculation swirled that the Shenzhen government had funded his work. Local officials have denied it.
At the core of Dr. He’s legal problems is informed consent. Chinese medical ethics guidelines require that researchers obtain verbal consent from the subjects of their work. Civil charges can be brought against researchers who exaggerate the benefits of a particular experiment while playing down the risks.
Dr. He said he had recruited couples in which the man had H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. He then used in vitro fertilization to create human embryos genetically altered to be resistant to H.I.V. infection. But there are simpler ways of preventing H.I.V. infection that do not involve the risks of such a trial.
Bai Hua, the head of Baihualin, an AIDS support group that helped Dr. He recruit the couples, said that he now regretted doing so and was deeply worried about the families. In a statement posted on the social media platform WeChat, Mr. Bai, who uses a pseudonym, said he felt “deceived.”
One H.I.V.-infected man whom Dr. He’s team tried to recruit said he was not told of the ethical concerns about editing human embryos, according to Sanlian Life Weekly, a Chinese newsmagazine.
Dr. He’s case has underscored China’s lack of updated laws governing genetic research.
A former vice minister of health, Huang Jiefu, has called for the establishment of a central organization to supervise bioscience experiments, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. He said the country’s 2003 regulations governing embryo experiments — which the government says Dr. He violated — were outdated.
Dr. He, who is in his mid-30s, studied at Rice University in Houston, where he first worked with Crispr. He conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University.",0

NASA is proposing launching private astronaut missions at the International Space Station as early as 2020, the agency announced Friday.
As part of its directive to open the station for commercial use, the US space agency will support up to two private astronaut missions to the space station each year. The missions can be up to 30 days each.
The private astronauts will take a NASA-approved commercial space vehicle to the space station, and they will conduct commercial and marketing work on the station or in work spaces attached to the station, according to NASA's press release.
These are work trips, according to the NASA directive released Friday (PDF).
Your work must either connect to NASA's mission; require ""the unique microgravity environment"" of the space station for your manufacturing, production or development process; or ""support the development of a sustainable LEO (low Earth orbit) economy.""
You've also got to be in shape, meeting NASA's tough medical standards and the space station's training and certification requirements.
And it'll cost you: Upwards of $35,000 per night for room and board -- and air -- at the International Space Station.
And it'll cost millions to get there and back, since your transportation to the station must take place in a US spacecraft developed under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
Launching private astronaut missions is part of a larger effort to expand commercial activity at the space station beyond the research and development currently limited by the ISS National Lab mandate.
The newest NASA directive is intended to allow ""commercial manufacturing and production and allow both NASA and private astronauts to conduct new commercial activities aboard the orbiting laboratory.""
In a separate research announcement, NASA laid out several requirements that must be met, including a feasibility assessment, before such missions would be allowed.",1
94,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/health/human-gene-editing-panel.html?_r=0,"Human Gene Editing Receives Science Panel’s Support
An influential science advisory group formed by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine on Tuesday lent its support to a once-unthinkable proposition: the modification of human embryos to create genetic traits that can be passed down to future generations.
This type of human gene editing has long been seen as an ethical minefield. Researchers fear that the techniques used to prevent genetic diseases might also be used to enhance intelligence, for example, or to create people physically suited to particular tasks, like serving as soldiers.
The advisory group endorsed only alterations designed to prevent babies from acquiring genes known to cause “serious diseases and disability,” and only when there is no “reasonable alternative.” The report provides an explicit rationale for genetic research that the federal government has avoided supporting until now, although the work is being pursued in countries like Sweden and China.
So-called germ line engineering might allow people to have biological children without fear that they have passed on the genes for diseases like Huntington’s, Tay-Sachs and beta thalassemia, and without discarding embryos carrying the disease-causing mutations, as is often done now. Though such cases are likely to be rare, the report says they should be taken seriously.
The new report heralds a day scientists have long warned is coming. After decades of science-fiction movies, cocktail party chatter and college seminars in which people have idly debated the ethics of humanity intervening in its own evolution, advancing technology dictates that the public now make some hard choices.
“It is essential for public discussions to precede any decisions about whether or how to pursue clinical trials of such applications,” said R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a leader of the panel that wrote the report. “And we need to have them now.”
Just over a year ago, an international group of scientists said it would be “irresponsible to proceed” with making heritable changes to the human genome until risks could be better assessed and there was “broad societal consensus about the appropriateness” of any proposed change.
No one is pretending that such a consensus now exists. But in the year that the committee was deliberating, Ms. Charo said, the techniques required to perform this sort of gene editing have passed crucial milestones.
The advent of a powerful gene-editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 allows researchers to snip, insert and delete genetic material with increasing precision. It has led to plans for experimental treatments of adult patients with cancer, blindness and other conditions as early as this year.
But these types of genetic alterations are not inherited.
“Previously, it was easy for people to say, ‘This isn’t possible, so we don’t have to think about it much,’” said Richard Hynes, a cancer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped lead the committee with Ms. Charo.
“Now we can see a path whereby we might be able to do it, so we have to think about how to make sure it’s used only for the right things and not for the wrong things,” he said.
A more pragmatic concern driving the committee was the likelihood that the new technology would be adopted in countries like China, where some pioneering research on editing human embryos — without the intent to gestate them — has already occurred.
“If we have an absolute prohibition in the United States with this technology advancing, it’s not like it won’t happen,” Ms. Charo said.
But opponents of human germ line editing say that is not a reason to take a big step toward what they fear will be an inevitable push to engineer traits like strength, beauty and intelligence, perhaps eventually creating a dystopian social divide between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot.
“This opens the door to advertisements from fertility clinics of giving your child the best start in life with a gene-editing packet,” said Marcy Darnovsky, the executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society, a public interest group in Berkeley, Calif. “And whether these are real advantages or perceived advantages, they would accrue disproportionately to people who are already advantaged.”
The new guidelines, Ms. Darnovsky noted, also set the United States apart from many European countries that have signed a treaty to refrain from human germ line editing.
In addition to social concerns, there are questions of safety and autonomy. While Crispr is generally precise, it can have “off-target” effects, cutting DNA at places where it is not meant to. What if a child produced through a gene-editing technique were hobbled in some unforeseen way?
The new report called for prohibiting any alterations resembling “enhancement”, including “off label” applications. Under the guidelines, a genetic technique aimed at strengthening the muscles of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for instance, could not be used to make healthy people stronger.
But it is not clear who would draw those lines.
George Church, a geneticist at Harvard University, saw no clear prohibitions against certain enhancements in the report. “If these fixes for severe diseases are shown to be safe and effective, why would small or large enhancements accompanying the fixes be unacceptable?” he asked.
No one should expect to design a baby anytime soon. It will probably be years before gene-editing techniques tested in animals can be shown to work in humans. And for the moment, the Food and Drug Administration is prohibited from using federal money to support research that results in genetically modified offspring.
In the meantime, said Sharon Terry, the president of the Genetic Alliance, a patient advocacy group, patients who may participate in clinical trials must begin a conversation. “My hope is that there would be serious considerations about what we are balancing here,” she said.",0

Now, He Jiankui and two of his associates have been sentenced to three years in prison following a secret trial in China.

He will also pay a 3 million yuan ($429,000) fine and be banned from reproductive medicine for life. His co-workers, Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, will also receive prison terms of two years and 18 months, respectively, on top of fines and bans. There were a total of ten authors on the scientific paper released by the team, but it's not clear if others will be penalized, as well.

MOSCOW (AP) — A U.S.-Russian crew landed safely Friday in the steppes of Kazakhstan following a stint on the International Space Station and was greeted with extra precautions due to the coronavirus.
NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan. and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka touched down as scheduled at 11:16 a.m. (0516 GMT) Friday. Their Soyuz capsule landed under a striped orange-and-white parachute about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Dzhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan.
On Friday, Russia’s space corporation Roscosmos said it had 42 coronavirus cases and reported the first deaths. It said two workers who died had tested positive for the virus and another employee, who died of pneumonia, was suspected of having the infection.
Russian officials said they took stringent measures to protect the crew members amid the pandemic. The recovery team and medical personnel assigned to help the three out of the capsule and to perform post-flight checks were under close medical observation for nearly a month before the landing and were tested for the coronavirus.
Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin said the three astronauts were feeling well.
Morgan wrapped up a 272-day mission on his first flight into space. He conducted seven space walks, four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.
Meir and Skripochka spent 205 days in space, with Meir carrying out the first three all-women spacewalks with crewmate Christina Koch, who returned from space in February.
The crew members smiled as they talked to medical experts wearing masks. Following a quick checkup, they were flown by helicopter to Baikonur. From there, Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, while Morgan and Meir will be driven from Baikonur to Kyzylorda, 300 kilometers (190 miles) away, to board a NASA flight to Houston.
Restrictions on international flights imposed by Kazakhstan required the long drive, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew’s return.
“A 300-kilometer ride after landing is quite a load on the astronauts,” he said, adding that Russia deployed its doctors to help the astronauts during the journey, if needed.
Skripochka will spend three weeks under observation at a medical facility at the Star City cosmonaut training center outside Moscow, Russian space corporation Roscosmos said. Star City officials said the medical personnel monitoring him will wear hazmat suits to protect him from becoming infected with the new virus.
On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first infection at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of U.S., Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station. The Star City also has residential quarters for cosmonauts and support staff.
The crew returned to Earth exactly 50 years after the Apollo 13 astronauts splashed down in the Pacific after an oxygen tank explosion aborted the moon-landing mission.
Speaking from the orbiting outpost before their landing, the three said that coming back to a world drastically changed by the pandemic would be challenging. Morgan said they tried to keep up with coronavirus news in space, but added that it was hard to comprehend what was really going on below.
“It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” Meir said. “We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.”
A new crew comprising NASA’s Chris Cassidy and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner arrived at the station on April 9. They said before blastoff that they had been under a very strict quarantine for a month before the flight and felt well.",1

Almaty (Kazakhstan) (AFP) - Two NASA astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut on Friday made a safe return from the International Space Station to find a ""different planet,"" transformed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir and Oleg Skripochka touched down in central Kazakhstan at 0516 GMT in the first returning mission since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March.
Morgan had been on the ISS since July last year, while Meir and Skripochka arrived in September.
""TOUCHDOWN! Welcome home, Oleg Skripochka, Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir!"" Russia's Roscosmos space agency wrote on Twitter.
Unusually, NASA and Roscosmos did not show live footage of the trio parachuting down in their Soyuz landing capsule.
This was scrapped ""due to technical limitations associated with the epidemiologicalsituation,"" Roscosmos said.
Subsequent footage from the landing site showed recovery crews wearing face masks and rubber gloves as they hauled the crew members out of the Soyuz MS-15 capsule, which was lying on its side.
""Please keep your distance,"" one ground crew member could be heard telling another.
While the trio's landing site southeast of the Kazakh town of Dzhezkazgan is the same as for previous crews, the pandemic has forced changes to mission-end protocol.
The crew will not be flying back home via Kazakhstan's Karaganda airport as usual because it has been shut down, like so many other airports across the world.
Instead, Skripochka will fly from the Baikonur cosmodrome used to launch missions to the ISS while the NASA duo will take off in a plane from the steppe city of Kyzlorda after a drive of several hours.
""Quite a ride home from @Space_Station today,"" Meir tweeted late on Friday.
""We've returned to a different planet, but it remains a spectacular one.""
Prior to departure, Meir said it would be difficult to forego embraces with family and friends as she gets to grips with a new culture of physical distancing on Earth.
""I think I will feel more isolated on Earth than here,"" reflected Meir, who made history as one half of the first all-women spacewalk along with NASA colleague Christina Koch in October.
- End to Russian monopoly -
While the astronauts' home planet fights the global battle against COVID-19, the ISS is also entering a new era as it prepares to welcome the first crew flown by Elon Musk's SpaceX company as early as next month.
NASA has said that the SpaceX flight taking NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS could launch as early as the second half of May, ending Russia's near decade-long monopoly on manned missions to the ISS from its Baikonur launchpad.
After blasting off from the Kennedy Space Centre, the pair will spend two to three months aboard the orbital lab, interrupting the usual rhythm aboard the ISS, where missions typically last around six months or longer.
They will be met by Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of Roscosmos and NASA's Chris Cassidy, who arrived at the ISS from Baikonur on April 9, the first new crew members to join after the pandemic began.
The International Space Station -- a rare example of cooperation between Russia and the West -- has been orbiting Earth at about 28,000 kilometres per hour (17,000 miles per hour) since 1998.",1
99,https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/nasa-and-spacex-set-historic-first-astronaut-launch-for-may-27/,"NASA and SpaceX have set a specific date and time target for their historic first astronaut launch aboard a private spacecraft from U.S. soil, with a planned date of May 27 and a target liftoff time of 4:32 PM EDT (1:32 PM PDT) from Kennedy Space Center, at SpaceX’s Launch Complex 39A (LC-39). The mission had been previously announced to be tracking toward a mid to late-May launch time frame, but now we know exactly when the agency and SpaceX hope to launch astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley for this inaugural trip to the International Space Station.
The launch is the first crewed mission in NASA’s Commercial Crew program, which seeks to return American launch capabilities to U.S. soil through private partnerships, with both SpaceX and Boeing taking part and developing their own separate launch vehicles and crew craft. SpaceX has taken all the steps necessary to get to this stage ahead of Boeing, and this flight, called Demo-2, while still technically part of the test program, will see NASA’s astronauts visit the space station for “an extended stay,” with a full duration yet to be determined.
This final test will validate each aspect of the Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 launch system, including the pad from which the rocket takes off, the operational facilities on the ground, orbital systems and astronaut procedures. Pending successful completion of all those elements, Crew Dragon should be set for full operational certification, after which time it can begin regularly scheduled service of delivering astronauts to and from the ISS.
For the mission, Crew Dragon will launch with Behnken and Hurley, then enter orbit and rendezvous with the ISS, which should occur around 24 hours after liftoff. The spacecraft is designed to dock fully autonomously with the station (and has done so on a previous occasion during an uncrewed demo mission), then Behnken and Hurley will disembark and join as members of the ISS crew, performing research on the orbital science platform.
The Crew Dragon flying this mission is designed to stay on orbit for around 110 days, but its actual length of stay will be decided by how ready the commercial crew mission to follow is at the time of launch. That Crew Dragon, which is the fully operational version, is designed for stays of at least 210 days, and the crew complement of four astronauts, including three from NASA and one from Japan’s space agency, is already determined. If all goes well, it’ll happen sometime later this year.
Crew Dragon from Demo-2 will perform an automated undocking from the ISS with Behnken and Hurley on board when it is ready to leave, and then they’ll re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and have a controlled splashdown landing in the Atlantic Ocean, where a SpaceX ship will pick them up and bring them back to Florida.
Obviously, NASA and SpaceX are facing challenges, along with everyone else, with the global COVID-19 crisis ongoing, but the agency has taken extra precautions to ensure this mission continues, since NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine notes that continued U.S. access to, and presence within the ISS is critical.",1
100,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-genome-editing-idUSL1N1FZ0SU,"CHICAGO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Although not ready yet, powerful gene editing tools may one day be used on human embryos, eggs and sperm to remove genes that cause inherited diseases, according to a report by U.S. scientists and ethicists released on Tuesday.
The report from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Academy of Medicine said scientific advances make gene editing in human reproductive cells “a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.”
The statement signals a softening in approach over the use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9, which has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.
In December 2015, scientists and ethicists at an international meeting held at the NAS in Washington said it would be “irresponsible” to use gene editing technology in human embryos for therapeutic purposes, such as to correct genetic diseases, until safety and efficacy issues are resolved.
The latest NAS report now says clinical trials for genome editing of the human germline could be permitted, “but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.”
CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.
Genome editing is already being planned for use in clinical trials of people to correct diseases caused by a single gene mutation, such as sickle cell disease. But these therapies affect only the patient.
The concern is over the use of the technology in human reproductive cells or early embryos because the changes would be passed along to offspring.
Research using the powerful technique is plowing ahead even as researchers from the University of California and the Broad Institute battle for control over the CRISPR patent.
Although gene editing of human reproductive cells to correct inherited diseases “must be approached with caution, caution does not mean prohibition,” the committee said in a statement.

The planned launch comes at a time when many events have been postponed or canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Travel restrictions prevented some of the astronauts' families, media and industry officials from attending the launch. Those involved in the launch were all seen keeping six feet apart and wearing masks.
But many of the health and safety precautions taken were standard for astronauts launching to the space station.
NASA has a long history of quarantining astronauts before they go to space to prevent illnesses like cold and flu from occurring off our planet. It was a concern even in the early days of the agency's astronaut program.
""The health and welfare of the crew is always paramount,"" said Courtney Beasley, communications specialist at NASA's Johnson Space Center. ""All of our crew must stay in quarantine for two weeks before they launch. This ensures that they aren't sick or incubating an illness when they get to the space station, and is called 'health stabilization.'""
Ahead of quarantine, the astronauts followed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations regarding coronavirus. NASA and the Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos, maintained the standard quarantine period of two weeks for the crew, Beasley said.
""During quarantine, the astronauts live in their crew quarters -- NASA has crew quarters for this purpose at Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers -- and Roscosmos has them in Baikonur,"" she said. ""They don't have direct contact with anyone who has not been pre-cleared by NASA flight surgeons. The time is spent preparing for flight, studying and resting, as well as working out and making video calls to friends and family members.""
About six hours after Thursday morning's launch, the astronauts docked with the International Space Station at 10:13 a.m. ET. The hatches opened at 12:28 p.m. ET and they joined Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan.
Skripochka and Meir will return to Earth on April 17 after spending six months on the station. Morgan, who will also return to Earth with them, launched to the station on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing and had an extended mission of eight months.
When Skripochka, Meir and Morgan return from their stay in space, they will be coming back to a very different Earth. When they launched, coronavirus wasn't a threat. Now, it's a pandemic.
NASA already has a protocol in place for returning astronauts that includes a post-landing medical check by flight doctors. The doctors and other NASA teams help the astronauts reacclimate to Earth's gravity, getting them up and walking soon after landing. In the weeks after, they're monitored to make sure they're healthy.
This time, the protocols will be more extensive.
""NASA will closely adhere to the CDC's recommendations on infection control for the coronavirus as Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir return to Earth and begin their post-flight medical testing and readaptation period,"" Beasley said.
""This includes cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home, and limiting contact with the crew members.""
On April 15, two days before the current crew returns to Earth, a ""change of command ceremony"" will take place on the station as the new crew takes over, according to NASA.
This is the third spaceflight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and it's the first for Vagner.
Cassidy was selected by NASA to be an astronaut in 2004. The Navy captain also served for 11 years as a member of the US Navy SEALs Team. His previous spaceflight experience includes a shuttle mission on Endeavour to help with assembly of the Space Station in 2009. During that flight, he became the 500th person in history to fly in space.
He also spent six months on the space station in 2013, one of the first crew members to participate in the new rendezvous system that shortened docking with the space station from two days to six hours.
Cassidy, Ivanishin and Vagner will also welcome NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley when they arrive at the space station in mid-to-late May on NASA's SpaceX Demo-2 flight test.
It will be the first time astronauts will launch into space aboard an American rocket and spacecraft from American soil since the final space shuttle mission in 2011. Since then, crews launching to the International Space Station have been leaving from Baikonur aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
Demo-2 is the final flight test of the system before SpaceX is certified to carry out operational crew flights to and from the space station for NASA, the agency said.
The agency is monitoring CDC guidance with regards to mission planning, they said. The launch date could be postponed.",1

The trio, Frenchman Thomas Pesquet, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy and American astronaut Peggy Whitson, launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Thursday.
Pesquet, a rookie astronaut and amateur saxophone player, is the first French national to be sent to the ISS by the European Space Agency since 2008.

A crew of three has returned from the International Space Station (ISS) to a very different planet they left last year.
No strangers to isolation, Russian Oleg Skrypochka and Jessica Meir from the US left Earth in September 2019, well before Covid-19 emerged.
Another American, Andrew Morgan, has been on the ISS since July 2019.
The coronavirus pandemic has changed the usual routine for returning space crews.
""It's quite surreal to see it unfolding on Earth below,"" Ms Meir told reporters during a recent video call. ""From here, Earth looks just as stunning as usual, so it's hard to believe all of the changes that have taken place since we left.""
The trio touched down on Earth at 05:16 GMT, with Mr Skrypochka and Ms Meir having spent 205 days in space, and Mr Morgan 272 days.
A series of posts on the official ISS Twitter account described how the crew's Soyuz ship split into three modules before the descent module reached the Earth's atmosphere ""creating a plasma trail"" early on Friday.
The capsule then landed successfully in Kazakhstan. US space agency Nasa posted a video of the astronauts being met by a mask-wearing rescue team.

The search party has been in strict quarantine and are believed to have undergone tests for coronavirus immediately before going out to pick up the arrivals to ensure that they were not at risk of infecting them.
In normal circumstances the search team would pick up the crew and bring them to the closest airport, from where they would fly home. But Kazakhstan has declared a state of emergency and most of the airports are closed.
The Baikonur space launch pad, leased by Russia from Kazakhstan, is still operating and the three crew members will be flown there. The Russian will take a plane home while the Americans will be driven three hours south-east to Kyzylorda, from where a Nasa plane will fly them back to the US.
A replacement crew of two Russians and an American who flew to the ISS on 9 April also took the utmost precautions to avoid taking the infection into space, spending a month and a half in quarantine before the launch.
Usually, a team of returning astronauts and cosmonauts will undergo a special rehabilitation program lasting several weeks. After a long stay in zero gravity, the body needs time to get used to life in constant gravity.
But this time doctors have the additional task of protecting the crew from coronavirus.
""It will be difficult to not give hugs to family and friends after being up here for seven months,"" Ms Meir said on the video call before returning to Earth. Last year she made history after completing the first ever all-female spacewalk with another Nasa astronaut, Christina Koch.
""I think I will feel more isolated on Earth than here. We're busy with amazing pursuits and tasks and don't feel the isolation,"" she added.

Nasa is shutting down two of its space centres to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The US space agency said it will suspend work at its Michoud facility in New Orleans, where a Moon rocket, or Space Launch System, is being built.
Its Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, where the rocket booster is being tested, will also temporarily close.
This could delay Nasa's mission to send astronauts to the Moon in 2024.
The US now has more than 11,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including one known case at NASA's Stennis Space Center.
""Nasa will temporarily suspend production and testing of Space Launch System and Orion hardware,"" said its administrator Jim Bridenstine. The only workers allowed onsite will be those dealing with security and critical infrastructure.
""We realise there will be impacts to Nasa missions, but as our teams work to analyse the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the Nasa workforce,"" Mr Bridenstine added. ""There is no team better prepared for doing hard things.""
The delays will affect manufacturing and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion, the crew capsule that will carry the astronauts to the Moon. NASA had set a goal of the next Moon landing to happen by the end of 2024.
A test flight without any astronauts aboard, may also be delayed until after 2021.

Alexei Krasnov, in charge of manned flights at Roscosmos, said the decision was made by participants at the International Astronautical Congress in Naples, Italy, this week.
The two-person expedition - with crew members from Roscosmos and NASA - will be a first test, the result of which will determine whether all flights are extended to a year, he said.
“The fundamental decision has been made, only the formalities remain to be negotiated. So far, we are talking about a single mission,” Krasnov told RIA news agency.
“If it proves effective, we will be able to discuss with partner countries a permanent transition from half-year flights to year-long flights.”
Veteran Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, NASA astronaut Sunita Williams and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide are currently in orbit aboard the International Space Station.
They are to be joined by another trio - Kevin Ford, Oleg Novitsky and Yevgeny Tarelkin - due to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at the end of the month, their flight delayed by a week due to a technical equipment glitch.
Russia’s space programme has suffered a series of humiliating set-backs in recent months that industry veterans blame on a decade of crimped budgets and a brain drain.
While none of the mishaps have threatened crews, they have raised questions over Russia’s reliability, cost billions in losses and dashed Moscow’s dreams of ending a more than two-decade absence from deep space exploration.

The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis is even being felt in space.
Rising infection rates near key technical centres in Louisiana and Mississippi mean the US space agency is suspending production and testing of its Moon rocket and capsule systems.
The Trump administration had set 2024 for the first crewed mission to the lunar surface in 50 years – an already challenging target.
That date looks even more optimistic now.
Nasa said it had no choice but to suspend work on the construction of the rocket, called the Space Launch System, and the capsule, known as Orion.
The Stennis Space Center in Mississippi has had one confirmed infection among its staff, and although the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana hasn't yet had a COVID-19 case - growing infection rates in the communities around both complexes means a shut-down is the only sensible option.
Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine said staff were now moving to put hardware in a safe condition.
“We realise there will be impacts to Nasa missions, but as our teams work to analyse the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the Nasa workforce,” he added.
Engineers had been transferring the first core stage of the SLS from Michoud to Stennis for a test firing, after which the plan then was to take it to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for an uncrewed test flight.
The launch was being pencilled in for early next year. This mission, dubbed Artemis 1, would be followed by a crewed trip around the Moon, before the first planned landing, Artemis 3, in 2024.
Nasa has instigated teleworking across its organisation, but engineering work continues on a number of high-priority missions.
Key among these is the new Mars rover, Perseverance.
It's currently at Kennedy being prepared for a launch to the Red Planet in July/August.
This is a hard deadline for the robot. Because Earth-Mars journeys are only attempted when the planets are favourably aligned, the rover project will get bumped to 2022 if it misses the summer flight window.
Europe has already been forced into this position. Its Rosalind Franklin rover mission has been put back by 26 months.
The European Space Agency robot, a joint venture with Russia, was already struggling to meet its launch date because of a troublesome development schedule. But these difficulties were then further complicated by the inability of engineering teams to move around freely.

107,https://www.france24.com/en/20181127-gene-edited-babies-cloned-monkeys-china-tests-bioethics,"A Chinese scientist's claim that he created the world's first genetically-edited babies has shone a spotlight on what critics say are lax regulatory controls and ethical standards behind a series of headline-grabbing biomedical breakthroughs in China.
University professor He Jiankui on Sunday said the DNA of twin girls had been altered to prevent them from contracting HIV, but his claims prompted a fierce backlash from the scientific community who not only cast doubt over the breakthrough, but also questioned its morality.
China is seeking to become a leader in the fields of genetic research and cloning, forging ahead even as others hesitate over ethical issues.
Scientists in the country were the first to carry out gene editing on human embryos in 2015, although with mixed results, the British journal Nature reported in 2017. And earlier this year, Chinese scientists unveiled monkeys that were cloned using the same technique that produced Dolly the Sheep two decades ago.
While the procedure could boost medical research into human diseases, it also raised ethical questions about how close scientists have come to one day cloning humans.
- 'Head transplant' -
Italian surgeon Sergio Canavero sparked controversy last year when he claimed to have conducted the world's first head transplant on a corpse at a Chinese hospital, the state-run Global Times reported at the time, though other scientists have called his claims overblown.
On Sunday He, who was educated at Stanford University, announced in a YouTube video he had used CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision, to modify the twins' DNA.
The tool has not been used in human trials in the United States, though doctors in China have been applying it to treat cancer patients.
Qiu Renzong, former vice president of the Chinese health ministry's ethics committee, accused He of obtaining a ""fraudulent"" ethics review by going to another hospital for review as opposed to obtaining approval from his own university, adding he was destroying the reputation of China's scientists.
Qiu said a lack of regulation mean that scientists often face no punishments as they are only required to abide by the rules of their institutions, which may not stipulate punishments for misconduct.
""People say the ministry is without teeth, cannot bite people. So we try to provide the teeth to the ministry head, so they can bite people when people violate the regulations,"" he told reporters in English at a gene editing conference in Hong Kong.
""The mainland is very protective of scientists, if you make some small mistake, that's the end of it, there's no punishment. I suggest that they should be punished,"" he added.
- 'Crazy' experiment -
With a sceptical research community waiting for evidence of He's claims, the scientist is expected to speak at the same conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday and Thursday.
He, who works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, faces scrutiny on the mainland too, with the National Health Commission ordering an investigation into the case.
A group of 122 Chinese scientists signed a joint statement calling the experiment ""crazy"" and said it was unfair to other scientists who stick to ""the moral bottom line"".
The Southern University of Science and Technology, where He works, said he had been on unpaid leave since February and his research is a ""serious violation of academic ethics and norms"".
A notice from Shenzhen's medical ethics authority said that all medical organisations must establish an ethics review committee before undertaking biomedical research concerning humans, and the ethics board of the hospital involved had not completed its registration as required.
He defended his research in another video, saying that he is trying to help families who carry genetic diseases.
""We believe ethics are on our side of history. Look back to the 1970s with Louise Brown. The same fears and criticisms then are repeated now,"" he said, referring to the first person to be born through in vitro fertilisation.
- $1 billion industry -
China has the second-largest genomics market worldwide, according to UBS. Beijing-based CCID Consulting estimates the market's value will nearly triple from 7.2 billion yuan ($1 billion) in 2017 to 18.3 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) by 2022.
Looser regulations have allowed China to get ahead in the biomedical field, said Michael Donovan, the founder of Veraptus, a biotech company in China.
But other factors such as a larger population providing a larger pool of potential patients, as well as regulatory support from the government also played a role, Donovan said.
""In many industries, the regulatory stance is that if there aren't laws for it, then they can proceed cautiously,"" he added.
""And that's the murky area that gene-editing is in right now.""
While certain hospitals can approve certain procedures without it going to a national approval body, it was ""very strange"" that He did not get a national authority's greenlight for such a ground-breaking experiment, Donovan said.
""From the ethical side you don't have the religious pool that we do in the United States,"" he said. ""But it is still life, so people are still concerned that we're moving forward too quickly with this.""

From the American frontier to the final frontier, turkey has served as the literal and figurative centerpiece of Thanksgiving celebrations for centuries.
To mark the holiday, SPACE.com partner collectSPACE.com prepared this feast of facts about the history of turkey in outer space, beginning with this year's orbital observance:
2012: Turkey without borders
""We will have a little Thanksgiving feast onboard,"" NASA astronaut and Expedition 34 commander Kevin Ford said Tuesday (Nov. 20) from on board the International Space Station (ISS). ""We have some smoked turkey, of course, to celebrate the holiday.""
Thermostabilized turkey and freeze-dried stuffing are on the menu for the U.S. astronaut and his two cosmonaut crewmates, Evgeny Tarelkin and Oleg Novitskiy.
""Thanksgiving isn't a holiday that the Russians celebrate, but we've found that on orbit, the crew members celebrate each others' holidays,"" Vickie Kloeris, the manager of the Space Food Systems Lab at Johnson Space Center in Houston, told SPACE.com. ""They will take part in Kevin Ford's celebration of Thanksgiving, just as American crew members will take part in some of the Russian holidays.""
This is the twelfth year that astronauts (and cosmonauts) have been on the station during Thanksgiving, since the complex's first crew took up residency in November 2000. [Astronaut's Space Thanksgiving Menu (Video)]
1973: First Thanksgiving off Earth
The first astronauts to spend ""Turkey Day"" in space did so aboard Skylab, the United States' first space station. The Skylab 3 (SL-4) crew of Jerry Carr, Bill Pogue and Ed Gibson arrived aboard the orbiting workshop just six days before Thanksgiving on Nov. 22, 1973.
Unlike most federal employees, the NASA astronauts did not have the holiday off. Gibson and Pogue performed a six and a half hour spacewalk that Thursday, floating like a pair of Thanksgiving Day parade balloons, replacing film cartridges and repairing an antenna outside the station.
In the process of completing the repair, Pogue ripped into an aluminum-coated plastic blanket to gain access to an electronics box. The blanket's scraps, liberated from the station, sparkled in the glint of the setting sun.
""While we had our turkey that evening, we were able to look out the window and see the twinkling tinsel of our unintentional Christmas decorations,"" Pogue later wrote in his book, ""How Do You Go to the Bathroom in Space?""
1972: Goodwill Turkey
The first and final missions to land men on the moon, Apollo 11 in July 1969 and Apollo 17 in December 1972, both had ""Turkey and Gravy"" on their crew menus (as did the missions that came between them). But the fowl food wasn't the only type of Turkey aboard the historic flights.
The missions, led by Neil Armstrong and Eugene Cernan respectively, also flew the flag of the Republic of Turkey. The red banner with its white star and crescent moon was part of the flights' flag kits, which held a colorful collection of state and country flags for post-flight presentation.
Similar flag kits were aboard the other Apollo flights, but Apollo 11's and Apollo 17's flags stand out for what they accompanied. After the missions returned to Earth, small samples of lunar material were encased in acrylic buttons, mounted to a wooden plaque and, with the flown flag of the nation, presented on behalf of the United States to the public of that country.
Turkey's Apollo 17 ""goodwill"" moon rock and flag that was flown to the moon is exhibited at the Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA) Natural History Museum in Ankara. The location of the country's Apollo 11-returned ""goodwill"" lunar sample display is currently unknown.
1968: Surprise turkey at the moon
The first mission to orbit the moon had turkey packed on board without the knowledge of the crew. Though the flight coincided with another holiday, the astronauts gave their thanks for the festive meal.
Arriving around the moon on Christmas Eve 1968, Apollo 8's commander Frank Borman had just finished lamenting to Mission Control about the freeze-dried holiday dinners he and his crewmates, James Lovell and Bill Anders, had aboard, when the three found the surprise meal waiting for them.
""In Apollo 8's food locker, wrapped in foil and tied with red and green ribbons: real turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce,"" historian Andrew Chaikin wrote in his 1994 book, ""A Man on the Moon."" The ""wetpack"" meal, developed by the military, was ""by far the best meal of the voyage.""

109,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-station-idUSTRE78E7IU20110915,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - Three International Space Station crewmembers climbed aboard a Soyuz capsule prepared for their return to Earth on Thursday, with their replacements delayed by an ongoing investigation into a Russian launch accident.
Former station commander Andrey Borisenko, cosmonaut Alexander Samokutyaev and U.S. astronaut Ron Garan sealed themselves inside one of two Russian Soyuz capsules parked at the outpost at 5:30 p.m. EDT (2130 GMT), closing out a five-month mission.
The Soyuz was scheduled to pull away from the station, a recently completed $100 billion project of 16 nations, at 8:38 p.m. (0038 GMT Friday). Touchdown in Kazakhstan is set for 12 a.m. EDT (0400 GMT) on Friday.
“It’s hard to believe it’s time,” said NASA astronaut Mike Fossum, the new station commander.
“We don’t want to see you go. We like the company. We love the friendship. We’ve lived together closer than families in many ways. We wish you all the best,” Fossum said during a farewell ceremony broadcast on NASA Television.
The returning crew’s replacements -- NASA flight engineer Dan Burbank and cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoly Ivanishin -- were scheduled to arrive September 24, but the flight was delayed following an August 24 launch accident involving an unmanned Russian cargo ship bound for the station.
The upper-stage motor that failed on the Russian Progress rocket, causing it to burn up in the atmosphere and shower debris across part of Siberia, is virtually identical to one used to fly crew to the station on Soyuz rockets.
The new crew is now scheduled to launch on November 14 and arrive at the station two days later.
The departure of Borisenko, Samokutyaev and Garan will leave Fossum, Japanese astronaut Satoshi Furukawa and Russia’s Sergei Volkov, on their own for an extended two-month period.
They will little time to prepare the new crew to take over the station before heading home themselves around November 22.
The Progress launch failure is believed to have been caused by blockage in a kerosene fuel line blockage. Russia plans to fly another cargo ship on October 30 before launching the next station crew.
With the retirement of the U.S. space shuttles this summer, crews can reach the station only aboard Russian rockets. China, the only other country able to fly people into orbit, is not a partner in the space station.
The current U.S. plan is to pay Russia to fly NASA astronauts, at a cost of more than $50 million per person, until U.S. companies are able to do so.

110,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223445/nasa-russia-astronauts-space-station-return-from-space-meir-morgan,"On Thursday afternoon, three astronauts on board the International Space Station will load into a Russian Soyuz capsule and embark on the more than three-hour journey back home to Earth — just a week after another crew of three joined them on the ISS. The trio is set to land in the Kazakhstan desert after 1AM ET on Friday, April 17th, where a smaller-than-usual welcoming committee will be on hand to greet them.
The returning astronauts include NASA’s Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan as well as Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka. Morgan has been on the ISS for up to 272 days, while Meir and Skripochka have been on board for 205. Meir made history last year when she performed the first all-female spacewalk with her friend and fellow astronaut Christina Koch. The pair went on to do two more all-female spacewalks together while they were both on the station.
Since the three astronauts are returning in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, extra precautions are being taken when they arrive back on Earth. Typically, a very large crowd of people greets the returning astronauts in Kazakhstan and helps them out of their capsule. A smaller team than usual will meet the crew this time, according to NASA. The crew will still go through a routine medical check from NASA flight doctors once they’re removed from the Soyuz capsule. And they’ll continue to be evaluated by medical personnel for weeks and months afterward, though NASA is going to be extra careful about follow-up exams.
“NASA will closely adhere to the CDC’s recommendations on infection control for the coronavirus as Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir return to Earth and begin their post-flight medical testing and re-adaptation period,” a NASA spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. “This includes cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home and limiting contact with the crew members.”
Once the crew lands, Morgan and Meir will board a NASA plane bound for Houston, which is routine for NASA astronauts who land in Kazakhstan. Russia recently closed its borders to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, but NASA says it has worked with Russia’s space organization, Roscosmos, as well as the US embassies in Russia and Kazakhstan to make sure that the astronauts and NASA launch crew can get back to the US. “Backup plans are in place to ensure our personnel are supported as conditions change,” a NASA spokesperson said. “We appreciate all the support of our international partners to ensure we can safely continue our mission.”
Morgan, Meir, and Skripochka will close the hatch of their Soyuz around 6:30PM ET. They’ll detach from the station at 9:53PM ET and spend the next few hours distancing themselves from the orbiting lab. Once it’s far enough away, the Soyuz will fire its engines at around 12:22AM ET to take the vehicle out of orbit and begin the descent through Earth’s atmosphere. About an hour later, at 1:17AM ET, the Soyuz is slated to land in Kazakhstan with the aid of its parachutes.
NASA plans to provide live coverage throughout the evening, starting at 4:55PM ET when Skripochka hands over command of the ISS to NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy. Check back throughout the night to watch the crew come home.

The local food movement has now reached outer space.
On Monday, after watching a batch of “Outredgeous” red romaine lettuce grow under a purplish glow in the microgravity of space, NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station harvested their own fresh produce.
The vegetable experiment had been a long-awaited harvest for the astronauts, who say that the ability to grow and sustain crops in space may someday aid travelers on long space trips. Cultivating crops is seen as a critical step in the path to traveling to Mars, for instance.
Before the harvest, the astronauts did what any sensible Earthling with a Wi-Fi connection would do: They celebrated lunch in an exclusive locale by tweeting a picture of the goods.
Tomorrow we'll eat the anticipated veggie harvest on @space_station! But first, lettuce take a #selfie. #YearInSpace pic.twitter.com/fUKQMhEDjK— Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) August 9, 2015
“All right, so,” Kjell Lindgren said Monday before clipping the first batch of romaine. “Who wants lettuce?”
But only half of the lettuce was meant for instant consumption. The rest will be set aside to be packaged and frozen on the station until it can be returned to Earth for analysis, according to a statement from NASA.
The astronauts used extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dress the leaves, which had first been cleaned with sanitizing wipes.
It was a long path from farm to table: The romaine seeds had been on the station for 15 months before being activated.
Finally, the astronauts were able to taste.
The verdict:
“That’s awesome,” Mr. Lindgren said.
“Kind of like arugula,” said another space farmer, the astronaut Scott Kelly.
After the snack, Mr. Lindgren told mission control that, as an astronaut, he saw a psychological benefit to growing a living crop aboard a space station, where the view often consists of white and aluminum.
Dr. Gioia Massa, the NASA payload scientist for the veggie experiment, said that the benefits of fresh produce for space travelers were clear.
“The farther and longer humans go away from Earth, the greater the need to be able to grow plants for food, atmosphere recycling and psychological benefits,” she said in a statement on Monday.
Plant harvesting in space is a solitary life, but sometimes social media helps. Back on Earth, supporters sent the astronauts messages of solidarity.",1
112,https://www.france24.com/en/20181004-astronauts-return-earth-iss-amid-us-russia-tensions,"Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut returned to Earth Thursday wrapping up a six-month mission at the International Space Station as tensions between Washington and Moscow threaten a rare area of cooperation.
NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold and Oleg Artemyev of Roscosmos touched down on steppe land southeast of the Kazakh town of Dzhezkazgan at the expected time of 1145 GMT.
The landing is the first since Russian space chief Dimitri Rogozin bemoaned ""problems"" in the Russian space agency's cooperation with NASA that he attributed to interference from unnamed American officials this week.
The outspoken official also said Russian investigators believed a small hole that appeared in a Russian space craft docked at the orbiting station in August causing an air leak on the ISS had been made deliberately.
Feustel has called the suggestion that the crew was somehow involved ""embarrassing"" and NASA on Wednesday expressed doubts over the theory that the hole was the result of sabotage.
The ISS is one of the few areas of tight Russia-US cooperation that remains unaffected by the crisis in ties, including after Washington's sanctions against Russia over Ukraine and other crises.
Earlier the ISS hosted the usual emotional goodbyes as the returning trio left Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, NASA's Serena Auñón-Chancellor and Roscosmos' Sergey Prokopyev waiting for the next three-person crew's arrival.
The next launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is scheduled for next Thursday.
Feustel invoked Hollywood comedy actor Jack Black's character Nacho Libre as he tweeted farewell to life on the space station.
""I have had my 'glory days in the hot sun' and now it's time to come home,"" he wrote in a tweet late on Wednesday that included a photo of the sun taken from the ISS.

113,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/asia/gene-editing-babies-china.html,"In China, Gene-Edited Babies Are the Latest in a String of Ethical Dilemmas
BEIJING — First it was a proposal to transplant a head to a new body. Then it was the world’s first cloned primates. Now it is genetically edited babies.
Those recent scientific announcements, generating reactions that went from unease to shock, had one thing in common: All involved scientists from China.
China has set its sights on becoming a leader in science, pouring millions of dollars into research projects and luring back top Western-educated Chinese talent. The country’s scientists are accustomed to attention-grabbing headlines by their colleagues as they race to dominate their fields.
But when He Jiankui announced on Monday that he had created the world’s first genetically edited babies, Chinese scientists — like those elsewhere — denounced it as a step too far. Now many are asking whether their country’s intense focus on scientific achievement has come at the expense of ethical standards.
“He studied in the United States, why did he only do this in China?” said Wang Yifang, a medical ethics expert with the School of Medical Humanities at Peking University. “It may still be related to the fact that we have a gap in our ethical supervision — it is not very strict, and some people think it’s dispensable.”
More than 100 Chinese scientists have denounced Dr. He’s research — genetically altering embryos that he implanted in a woman who later gave birth to twin girls — as “crazy.” China’s vice minister of science and technology said Thursday that Dr. He’s scientific activities would be suspended, calling his conduct “shocking and unacceptable.”
President Xi Jinping has set a goal of turning China into “a global scientific and technology power” by 2049. Faced with a population that is growing sicker and older, the government is spending millions of dollars specifically on becoming a leader in “genetic manipulation technology.”
To strengthen its position, the government has sought to lure home successful Western-trained Chinese researchers like Dr. He. He was a beneficiary of the Thousand Talents Plan, which gives scientists tens of thousands of dollars in funding and help with housing and schooling for their children.
Before he became infamous this week, those who knew of Dr. He saw him as a modern Chinese success story.
He was born to farmers in one of the poorest parts of Hunan Province in southern China. As a high school student, he built a small laboratory at home, believing he could be China’s Einstein, according to an article this week by Jiemian, a Chinese news website. He graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China with a physics degree.
But by the time he arrived in the United States on a Chinese government scholarship, Dr. He felt the golden age of physics was over, according to the article. He switched to biophysics and studied at Rice University in Houston, where he first worked with Crispr, the gene-editing technology he says he used to alter the babies’ genes.
After studying at Rice, Dr. He went on to postdoctoral research at Stanford University. In 2012, he returned to China, basing himself in the booming southern metropolis of Shenzhen, which gave him funding. Dr. He founded two genetic testing companies, Direct Genomics and Vienomics, which aimed to use gene sequencing for medical purposes.
Many scientists in China say the drive to succeed is so strong that they adopt a “do first, debate later” approach. Wang Yue, a professor at the institute of medical humanities of Peking University, said many scientists lacked awareness of medical ethics and of laws and regulations relevant to their fields.
“It is true that many scientists are very bold and think of science as their independent kingdom,” Dr. Wang said. “So they are not willing to listen to the outside world, including ethics committees and administrative agencies that want to supervise and review them.”
In China, clinical trials are vetted for ethical concerns just once, by a hospital’s ethics review committee. Dr. He said his research was approved by the ethics board of the hospital Shenzhen Harmonicare. The hospital denied that, although one of its shareholders had appeared in an Associated Press video talking about Dr. He’s project.
Adding to the confusion, the university to which Dr. He is attached, the Southern University of Science and Technology, said it had had no idea that Dr. He was conducting research on babies, even though he said he got his funding from the university. At the genome editing conference in Hong Kong, Dr. He acknowledged that he had not informed his university about his research.
Dr. He told a genome editing conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday that he was proud of what he had done, saying he intended to engineer babies who would not be vulnerable to H.I.V. infection. He recruited couples for his research in which the man had H.I.V. and the woman did not.
Many scientists have noted that there are simpler ways to protect newborn babies with an infected parent from getting H.I.V. But Chinese couples have less access to such treatments because of a law barring people with “sexual diseases,” including H.I.V., from in vitro fertilization treatment. That suggests that Dr. He would have been more likely to find willing recruits among couples living with H.I.V.
Bai Hua, the head of Baihualin, an AIDS advocacy group that helped Dr. He recruit the couples, said that he now regretted doing so and was deeply worried about the families. In a statement posted on his organization’s official WeChat account, Mr. Bai, who uses a pseudonym, said he felt “deceived, but I don’t want to shirk responsibility.”
“I hope to use this venue to launch a specific appeal,” Mr. Bai wrote. “With the occurrence of this incident, please conduct more ethics-related science and medical training for volunteers in the AIDS community as well as medical workers and staff in these related fields.”
At the conference in Hong Kong this week, Dr. He said the parents of the twins and seven other couples who participated in his research had been fully informed of the risks involved, and that they understood what was being done to their embryos.
But one H.I.V.-infected man Dr. He’s team tried to recruit said he was not told of the ethical concerns about editing human embryos, according to Sanlian Weekly, a Chinese newsmagazine. The man said a researcher had told him that the probability of his having an unhealthy baby was low and that the team had achieved a high success rate in testing with animals.
The man said the researcher left him feeling that the procedure had more potential for benefits than risks. But his wife was concerned that harvesting the eggs would be painful, and the man decided not to sign up, according to the article.
Dr. He’s announcement was a moment of reckoning for gene editing well beyond China. Jennifer Doudna, a co-inventor of Crispr and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was “an opportunity to change how we’re regulating scientific use of this technology,” possibly by making the “somewhat vague” guidelines more specific. She said severe consequences could be established for breaking those guidelines, perhaps even involving an international body like the United Nations.
In China, many say an update of the laws governing genetic research is long overdue. A former vice minister of health, Huang Jiefu, called for the establishment of a central body to supervise bioscience experiments, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. He said the country’s 2003 regulations governing embryo experiments — which the government says Dr. He violated — were outdated.
Wang Yuedan, a professor of immunology at Peking University, said the penalties for violating those regulations were not harsh enough. They are not legally binding and do not detail any punishments.
“What happened this time was an ethics disaster for the world,” Dr. Wang said. “But perhaps it will encourage biomedical research scientists all over the world, including China, to pay more attention to the ethical guidelines regarding the human body.”",0
114,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/china-gene-edited-babies-he-jiankui-investigation-government-hiv-crispr-a8738476.html,"“This behaviour seriously violates ethics and the integrity of scientific research, is in serious violation of relevant national regulations and creates a pernicious influence at home and abroad,” it said.
Dr He revealed his work to the world at a conference in Hong Kong after press reports began circulating, but he has still not released any data to back up his claims.
British geneticist Professor Robin Lovell-Badge pointed out the Chinese scientist had no background in biology, and appeared to not fully grasp the implications of his work.
While the technology known as Crispr-Cas9 has seen a vast leap forward in recent years, it is still considered unsafe and unethical to apply it to human embryos with the intention of producing gene-edited humans.
However, there is still confusion about which laws Dr He and his team have technically broken.
Legal scholars have pointed to a guideline that bans altered human embryos from being implanted for the purpose of reproduction, and says altered embryos cannot be developed for more than two weeks.
An unnamed spokesperson from the investigating team said the case files of all those involved who were suspected of committing crimes had been sent to the Ministry of Public Security.
Chinese authorities have temporarily suspended all research involving human gene editing, and Dr He is apparently residing under armed guard at a university guesthouse

Dr Helen O’Neill, a reproductive scientist at University College London, said the new report still did not shed light on the full story.
“There is no further clarification on what measures will be taken to prevent this happening in future, nor what will be done as punishment for He Jiankui’s lack of regard for policy, the patients and the scientific community,” she said.

Scientist He Jiankui said this week that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of the twin girls born this month.
He’s announcement, which has not been verified, sparked an international outcry about the ethics and safety of such research.
“The nature of this incident is extremely nasty, and relevant bodies have been ordered to temporarily halt the scientific research activities of relevant personnel,” the state news agency Xinhua said, citing the health ministry, science and technology ministry and China Association for Science and Technology.
The organizers of a conference where He claimed to have edited the genes also condemned the work on Thursday, calling it “deeply disturbing” and “irresponsible”.
“Even if the modifications are verified, the procedure was irresponsible and failed to conform with international norms,” the organizing committee of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, being held in Hong Kong this week, said in a statement.
The committee called for an independent assessment of He’s claims.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Chinese scientists have also condemned the work and the Southern University of Science and Technology, where He is on leave from his position as an associate professor, has announced an investigation.
The Guangdong province Health Commission said on its website on Wednesday it and Shenzhen city had set up a team to investigate the case.
He’s filing to a Chinese clinical trials database indicates that a hospital did an ethical review of the project, but the hospital involved denied that its ethics review committee ever met to discuss the work.
He said after his presentation on Wednesday he was proud of what he had done.
The presidents of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM) also expressed concern about He’s work.
“The events in Hong Kong this week clearly demonstrate the need for us to develop more specific standards and principles that can be agreed upon by the international scientific community,” NAS president Marcia McNutt and NAM president Victor Dzau said in a statement.

116,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/elon-musk-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-over-a-million-dollars-less-to-insure.html,"- SpaceX CEO Elon Musk touted low insurance costs as proof of the improving reliability of his company's Falcon 9 rockets.
- ""Last I checked, over a million dollars less ... to insure a Falcon 9 mission,"" Musk said in tweets Wednesday evening.
- A top space insurance underwriter explained that Musk's reference is true for insurance premiums, which are based on the rocket's price tag, but not for the insurance rate, which is based on the market's perceived reliability of the rocket.
SpaceX is launching more often than any other country or company and CEO Elon Musk touted low insurance costs as proof of the improving reliability of his company's Falcon 9 rockets.
""Last I checked, over a million dollars less ... to insure a Falcon 9 mission,"" Musk said in tweets Wednesday evening.
Insurance on a launch is ""the acid test"" for the reliability of a rocket, Musk added in another tweet. A top space insurance underwriter, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNBC that Musk's reference is true for insurance premiums, which are based on the rocket's price tag, but not for the insurance rate, which is based on the market's perceived reliability of the rocket.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a $62 million price tag. The insurance rate on a Falcon 9 is about 4% currently, the underwriter said. That's the same rate as competitors' similarly-capable rockets, such as the European launcher Arianespace's Ariane 5 or U.S. rocket builder United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas V. But Ariane 5 and Atlas V launches go for upwards of $165 million each, meaning a Falcon 9 premium is about $2.5 million while its competitors' premiums would be in the range of $7 million.
In essence, the underwriter said a Falcon 9 mission is cheaper to insure because the rocket costs less than competitors' – not necessarily because it is seen as more reliable. The underwriter added that Musk's method of comparing insurance premiums is additionally misleading given that launch insurance is almost always based on more than just the cost of a rocket itself. A launch insurance policy typically includes the cost of the launch vehicle, the price of the spacecraft it's launching and the amount paid for the insurance, the underwriter explained.
While SpaceX has had suffered two rocket failures in the past decade, the company's Falcon 9 has successfully launched 81 times.
Reusing rockets as a way to save money
The price tag for a Falcon 9 launch can vary greatly depending on what a customer demands. In recent military launch contracts, the Air Force awarded SpaceX about $95 million per launch – as the national security nature of the missions come with additional requirements for the company. But, when SpaceX re-uses parts of its rocket, the company says it can charge even less than its list price. In a briefing earlier this year, SpaceX director of vehicle integration Christopher Couluris said the company can ""bring launches down to below $30 million per launch.""
""[The rocket] costs $28 million to launch it, that's with everything,"" Couluris said, adding that reusing the rockets is what is ""bringing the price down.""
Competitors, such as the Boeing and Lockheed Martin-owned joint venture ULA, have remained skeptical of the efficacy of reusing rockets – especially since SpaceX and its financials remain private, even as its valuation has soared. But Musk has often pointed to reusing rockets as key to saving the company money.
SpaceX has been able to recover two major pieces of its rockets: The large ""first stage"" boosters and the rocket's nosecone (also known as its ""fairing""). The boosters, which SpaceX has often landed, make up about 60% of the total cost of the rocket, or about $37 million. SpaceX has also been able to recover the fairings – which make up about 10% of the total cost, or about $6 million – by either fishing them out of the ocean or catching them in large nets strung up behind boats.
Two years ago SpaceX debuted the final version of its Falcon 9 rocket, which Musk at the time said ""is capable of at least 100 flights."" SpaceX has since pared that rocket reuse goal down, as president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said last month that ""I don't actually think we're going to need to fly more than 10 times."" So far, SpaceX has launched and landed a single Falcon 9 booster five times.

117,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-nasa-launch-factbox-idUSKCN0JH2JO20141204,"(Reuters) - For the first time in more than 40 years, NASA is launching a spaceship designed to carry astronauts far beyond Earth. The Orion space capsule is due to blast off for an unmanned, trial run on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
Here is a look at the key milestones of the 4-1/2-hour flight:
To get as far away from Earth as possible, Orion is launching aboard a Delta 4 Heavy rocket, currently the biggest booster in the U.S. fleet. The 2-1/2-hour launch period opens at 7:05 a.m. EST (1205 GMT).
One minute, 25 seconds after liftoff, Orion goes supersonic.
Four minutes after liftoff, two of the Delta 4’s three liquid-fueled boosters are jettisoned.
Five minutes, 30 seconds, the last booster burns out and separates from the upper-stage engine.
Six minutes, 15 seconds, with the second-stage burning, three protective panels separate from Orion’s mock-up service module. Five seconds later, the launch escape system is jettisoned.
Seventeen minutes, the second-stage engine shuts down, leaving Orion in its initial orbit 115- by 552 miles (185- by 888 km) above Earth.
Three hours, after a second burn of the upper-stage engine, Orion passes through intense radiation in the Van Allen Belts and reaches its peak altitude of 3,600 miles (5,800 km).
Three hours, 23 minutes, Orion separates from its service module and the Delta upper stage and prepares to return to Earth.
Three hours, 57 minutes, Orion fires its steering thrusters to position itself for atmospheric re-entry.
Four hours, 13 minutes, Orion, traveling at 20,000 mph (32,000 km/h) reaches upper limits of Earth’s atmosphere.
Four hours, 15 minutes, Orion experiences peak heating of about 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 Celsius).
Four hours, 19 minutes, parachutes begin deploying to slow Orion’s descent.
Four hours, 23 minutes, Orion lands in the Pacific Ocean, 600 miles (965 km) off the coast of Baja California. Recovery teams will retrieve the capsule and take it to San Diego, California.

118,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225163/nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-falcon-9-commercial-dm-2-first-crewed-launch,"NASA and SpaceX are now targeting May 27th for the first crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon — a newly developed vehicle designed to take astronauts to the International Space Station. The demonstration mission, which will carry two NASA astronauts to orbit, will mark the first time people have launched from American soil since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.
This flight has been in the making for years, ever since NASA selected SpaceX and rival Boeing to develop new spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS as part of the Commercial Crew Program. SpaceX has been transforming its Dragon cargo capsule —which has been taking supplies to the ISS for years — into a vehicle that can carry people. After six years of development, as well as various testing successes and failures along the way, the capsule is ready to finally carry its first passengers on a flight test. NASA astronaut Doug Hurley will serve as the spacecraft commander while NASA astronaut Bob Behnken will be the joint operations commander.
Of course, the date for the mission comes at an incredibly difficult time as the world is still battling the COVID-19 pandemic. The launch is set to take place from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. On April 1st, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order for residents in the state to help combat the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, NASA has issued mandatory telework policies at all of its centers, with exceptions for essential personnel. However, the space agency says it is monitoring the pandemic as it prepares for the launch.
“NASA is proactively monitoring the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation as it evolves,” NASA said in a statement issued in March, when it sent out a call for press to cover the launch. “The agency will continue to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the agency’s chief health and medical officer and communicate any updates that may impact mission planning or media access, as they become available.”
Regardless of who is there to see it, the first crewed flight for the Crew Dragon is a huge deal for both NASA and SpaceX. It’ll mark the first time that SpaceX has launched people on any of its vehicles, and the launch will help verify if the Crew Dragon is ready to start regularly doing flights to and from the ISS. The flight will also help end NASA’s reliance on Russia, which is the only country currently capable of sending astronauts to the ISS. A lot is riding on this mission, even if the timing is not ideal.

He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
“For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,” He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.
Asked whether there were any other edited gene pregnancies as part of his trials, He said there was another “potential” pregnancy and replied “yes” to a follow-up question as to whether it was a “chemical pregnancy”, which refers to an early-stage miscarriage.
It was unclear whether the pregnancy had ended or not.
He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.
“This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,” He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organizers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.

The Chinese Society for Cell Biology in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes and said that it was against the law and medical ethics of China.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. “Pandora’s box has been opened,” they said.
INFORMED CONSENT
He, who said he was against gene enhancement, said eight couples were initially enrolled for his study while one dropped out. The criteria required the father to be HIV positive and the mother to be HIV negative.
Scientists at the conference pressed He to prove that those taking part in the trial were aware of all the risks involved in the process.
He said that all the participants had a “good education background” and went through two rounds of discussions with him and his team.
A 23-page English translation of an informed consent form for the potential mother said that the costs of the procedure covered by the team would be up to 280,000 yuan ($40,200) per couple.
The consent form mentions multiple risks, but there is little detail on potential complications of the gene-editing process itself, including for the child. It does not mention that such an experiment has never been done before.
David Baltimore, President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, spoke after He’s speech, saying it was irresponsible to have proceeded until safety issues were in order.
“I don’t think it has been a transparent process. Only found out about it after it happened and the children were born,” Baltimore said.
He Jiankui said his results could be used for millions of people with inherited diseases. He said he would monitor the two newborns for the next 18 years and hoped they would support continued monitoring thereafter.
Shenzhen Harmonicare Medical Holdings Limited 1509.HK, named as being involved in He's project in China's clinical trial registry, sought to distance itself by stating the hospital never participated in any operations relating to the gene-edited babies and no related delivery had taken place.
In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, the group said preliminary investigations indicated the signatures on the application form circulated on the internet are “suspected to have been forged, and no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”.
The Guangdong province Health Commission announced on its website on Wednesday that it and Shenzhen city had set up a joint team to investigate the case.

- The scare was a false alarm, NASA says
- The U.S. astronauts are safe, NASA says
(CNN)The U.S. crew aboard the International Space Station relocated from its quarters after what turned out to be a false alarm on Wednesday, NASA said.
A possible ammonia leak in the cooling system had the crew from the American segment of the station move temporarily to the Russian segment.
It was a false alarm, NASA said.
Tests indicated that the off-scale measurements were the result of a computer failure, and not an ammonia leak.
International Space Station program manager Mike Suffredini said the relocation was done as a precaution because of four measurements that were off scale. These measures could have indicated an ammonia leak.
The astronauts, as trained, put on masks, moved to the Russian segment, and closed the hatch to the American segment, he said.
Two U.S. astronauts are aboard the International Space Station: commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts.
Once it was determined that the emergency was a false alarm, the astronauts still had to wait while equipment on the U.S. segment was powered back up, Suffredini said.
NASA tweeted that at 3:05 p.m. ET, the hatch was reopened and the astronauts returned. There was no ammonia in the area, NASA said.
The crew was unable to carry out experiments that were planned, but no research was lost, Suffredini said.
The Americans were joined by Samantha Cristoforetti, a flight engineer with the European Space Agency, and others in the space station's six-member crew.
""Hey everybody, thanks for your concern,"" Cristoforetti tweeted. ""We're all safe & doing well in the Russian segment.""",1

- Published
China has halted the work of the scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies, and says it will investigate.
He Jiankui caused outrage earlier this week when he told a genome summit he had altered the genes of twin baby girls so they could not contract HIV.
His statement has not been confirmed, but if true breaks tight rules around the use of gene editing in humans.
Prof He's university said it was unaware of his experiment.
The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said earlier in the week he had been on unpaid leave since February, and it would be investigating the claims.
On Thursday, China's science ministry said it had ""demanded that the relevant organisation suspend the scientific activities of relevant personnel"".
The National Health Commission has already said Prof He's work ""seriously violates China's laws, regulations and ethical standards"" and would investigate the claims.
What the scientist claimed?
Prof He announced that he had altered the DNA of embryos - twin girls known as Lulu and Nana - to prevent them from contracting HIV.
Speaking to the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong, he said the girls were ""born normal and healthy"" and they would be monitored over the next 18 years.
He said he had funded the experiment himself and confirmed his university had not been aware of it.
Prof He also explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment. One couple dropped out, but there was ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo in its early stages.
He said his study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He was also evasive about other details, including the names of ""some experts"" he said had reviewed his work and offered feedback.
Why is his work controversial?
The Crispr gene editing tool he claims to have used is not new to the scientific world, and was first discovered in 2012.
It works by using ""molecular scissors"" to alter a very specific strand of DNA - either cutting it out, replacing it or tweaking it.
Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos.
But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes.
Hundreds of scientists, both in China and around the world, swiftly condemned his claims.
Professor Julian Savulescu, an ethics expert at the University of Oxford, said if true ""this experiment is monstrous"".
""Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer,"" he told the BBC. ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit.""
Many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby.
China allows in-vitro human embryonic stem cell research for a maximum period of 14 days, China's Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xu Nanping clarified.",0

China condemns the work of He Jiankui as institutions distance themselves from the academic who gene-edited twin girls.
Shenzhen, China – China has suspended He Jiankui – the scientist who claims to have produced the world’s first gene-edited babies. He now looks set to face punishment after publicly revealing research many in the scientific community condemned as irresponsible.
His work was “extremely abominable in nature”, Xi Nanping, vice minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, told state news agency Xinhua late on Thursday.
Xi said genetically engineering the DNA of twin girls so they would not develop HIV, breached scientific ethics, adding that gene-editing of human embryos for reproduction purposes was “explicitly banned” in China.
He admitted at a gene-editing conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday that he had already initiated another pregnancy, although it was too soon to tell if it would go to full term.
A source confirmed to Al Jazeera that He had returned to Shenzhen, although repeated calls to his mobile went unanswered and several messages sent to the phone were read with no response.
David Cyranoski of the journal Nature posted on social media that He was in the southern city and ready to “cooperate fully with all inquiries” about his work.
‘Resolutely dealt with’
The scientist is likely to face a barrage of questions from institutions in Shenzhen, as well as from the Ministry of Science and Technology. China’s National Health Commission said He’s activities would be investigated and any wrongdoing “resolutely dealt with”, according to Xinhua.
It is uncertain what punishment He may face since the law in China is vague on enforcement, according to Qiu Renzong, professor emeritus of the Institute of Philosophy and director of the Centre for Applied Ethics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
His research has sent shockwaves through the international scientific community, with many raising concerns over the lack of verified data and the risks of exposing healthy embryos to gene-editing. Scientists have long worried about the implications for humanity of such genetic engineering.
R Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, said if He had done the trial in the United States it “would have been in violation of public law” and involve “penalties [that] are both civil and criminal”. Approvals are needed through the Food and Drug Administration for human cells and therapy studies where cells are brought to gestation.
Police involvement?
Qiu noted in Hunan province in 2012, three researchers were arrested and then sacked along with three officials who approved trials of vitamin A-enriched genetically modified rice on schoolchildren without their consent.
“Three scientists were disciplined, they were dismissed from their positions, and they could not apply for grants over a certain period of time, so [He’s case] may be similar to this,” Qiu told Al Jazeera. “I don’t think the police will be involved, but the ministries will discipline him.”
He said in a video released on Sunday – the same day the world learned of the births – that he used the CRISPR-cas9 tool for editing the embryos in order to remove the possibility that the babies would get HIV from their father, who is infected with the virus.
Anthropologist Eben Kirksey remarked that CRISPR has become a magic word related to HIV because of the promise that “you only need to take the treatment once”. But, he added, there were many other promising therapies for treating HIV, and he didn’t think many in the HIV research community were “putting a lot of hope” in genetic editing.
He gave a partial apology in front of a packed auditorium at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong. The contrition, however, seemed to be more for the information about the births coming out before his research had been vetted by the scientific community, rather than for having carried it out.
The scientist told delegates he was “proud of” his work, adding that if the same situation occurred and it was his child he would “try it first”.
Most other researchers believed it was far too early to progress to that point given the vast ethical questions that arise from having “edited” – like Lulu and Nana, the names He gave the twin baby girls – and “non-edited” humans living side by side.
“Wouldn’t it be useful to try to define a global ethical code of conduct, at least a minimum of consent and what is research is and what is the standard?” asked Barbel Friedrich, director of the Alfried Krupp Institute for Advanced Studies in Greifswald. “What we heard this morning was a violation of law, which he admitted to, but what we need is a global rule.”
Institutions deny knowledge
Across the border in Shenzhen, institutions are distancing themselves from He.
Shenzhen’s Health and Family Planning Commission has directed the city’s medical expert committee to investigate He’s activities.
Southern University of Science and Technology, where He is an associate professor and is said to have conducted the research without the full knowledge of the university, has sealed off his lab and suspended him pending an investigation. The website on genome research related to He’s work now appears to be inaccessible.
When Al Jazeera visited the researcher’s lab, situated on a sprawling campus in a hub of universities in the northern part of Shenzhen, security officers refused entry, complaining about media trying to visit the site. Communications department officials at the school did not respond to requests to discuss the investigation into He’s research activities.
At the main gate, a police van was parked across the road, its blue and red lights flashing.
Shenzhen Harmonicare Women and Children’s Hospital, where the fertilisation allegedly took place, now denies involvement in He’s work and has said it believes a signature on papers approving the experiment were falsified. Attempts to reach officials at the hospital for further explanation were not successful.
“We don’t know yet whether that was fabricated,” Qiu said of the papers. “Some scientists, out of other motivations, these young scientists, they want to make a lot of money.”",0

- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
- Christopher CassidyFormer Commander of the International Space Station
Almaty (Kazakhstan) (AFP) - A three-man space crew finished preparations on Wednesday for a mission to the International Space Station, which is going ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic.
Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of Russia's Roscosmos space agency and NASA's Chris Cassidy will blast off from Kazakhstan for a six-month mission at 08:05 GMT Thursday.
But with journalists and relatives unable to travel to Baikonur due to restrictions related to COVID-19, the traditional farewell press conference broadcast by Roscosmos had a more distant and sombre feel.
""Instead of talking only to some cameras we would be talking to some people right now,"" said Cassidy, who is readying for his third stint in space.
Cassidy, 50, admitted that the crew was ""affected"" by their families not being able to be in Baikonur for their blastoff to the ISS.
""But we understand that the whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.""
Quarantine and isolation from the rest of the world are not new habits for astronauts.
The glass barrier that separates them from media and loved ones during regular pre-launch events is specifically meant to protect them from potential infection.
This time, however, their isolation has been ""even more thorough"", said Ivanishin, after the crew opted out of visits to sites in Moscow during their training an hour outside the city.
Thursday's launch will be the first time a manned mission uses a Soyuz-2.1a booster to reach orbit, after Roscosmos stopped using the Soyuz-FG rocket last year.
The newer boosters have been used in unmanned launches since 2004.
The upgraded rocket relies on a digital flight control system rather than the analogue equipment used in prior Soyuz models.
Ivanishin said the new system would be more independent and require less manual input from the crew in the event of emergencies.
""The system has become better, but it is early to say whether it will be easier to control,"" Ivanishin said.",1

NASA’s Orion spacecraft has returned safely to Earth after its historic test flight, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean 275 miles west of Baja California at 11:29 a.m. ET.
The splashdown, which was streamed live from a NASA drone, sparked scenes of celebration at the space agency’s Mission Control in Houston.
The unmanned spacecraft successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 7:05 a.m. ET., Friday, carried into space by a Delta IV Heavy Rocket. NASA had initially planned to launch Orion on Thursday, but was forced to scrub the liftoff following a series of delays and technical glitches.
NASA lauded the mission as a ""textbook"" maiden flight.
""Today was a great day for America - we challenge our best and brightest to continue to lead in space,"" said Orion's Lead Flight Director Mike Sarafin. ""While this was an unmanned mission, we were all on board Orion.""
The successor to the now-retired Space Shuttles re-entered Earth’s atmosphere at 11:19 a.m. ET, reaching a speed of around 20,000 mph and generating temperatures around 4,000 degrees on the spacecraft’s heat shield.
A series of parachutes successfully slowed the Orion crew module, with its three main parachutes deploying at 11:26 a.m. ET. The module was travelling at about 20 mph when it splashed down.
Orion remained “powered up” for an hour after splashdown, enabling contractor Lockheed Martin to get as much data as possible about the spacecraft’s performance.
After recovery teams from NASA and the U.S. Navy retrieve the module, it will be transported to San Diego aboard the USS Anchorage.
Friday’s 4 hour and 24 minute orbital mission took Orion deeper into space than any spacecraft built for humans has traveled in more than 40 years. Orion, which orbited the Earth twice, hit a maximum altitude of 3,604 miles shortly after 10 a.m. ET.
The crew module successfully separated from its service module at 10:28 a.m ET. Orion passed through the Van Allen radiation belt twice during its journey, with its systems performing perfectly, according to NASA.
Friday's flight, dubbed Exploration Flight Test-1, will provide NASA with vital information on the spacecraft’s performance. NASA plans to eventually use Orion on ambitious manned missions to Mars and an asteroid.
Chris Carberry, executive director of Explore Mars, a non-profit organization that aims to advance the goal of sending humans to Mars within the next two decades, told FoxNews.com that Friday's test flight is an important step forward.
""While Mars could be as many as 20 years off and we don't know exactly what hardware and vehicles will be used, the Orion test starts us on the path toward sending humans beyond Low Earth Orbit,"" he said. ""NASA plans to start going to intermediate destinations in the early 2020s, including the Asteroid Redirect mission - if we are going to accomplish that mission or go to any other destinations in the next few years, it is essential that we start testing hardware - as with EFT-1.""
Carberry, however, warned that ""sufficient and consistent"" budgets should be made available to support the goal of landing humans on Mars by the 2030s.
Orion was rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge its durability for the day when astronauts climb aboard during the decade ahead.
The $370 million test flight was managed by Lockheed Martin. The Delta IV Heavy Rocket was built by United Launch Alliance.
Future Orion launches will use the mega rocket still under development by NASA, known as SLS or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS launch is targeted for 2018, unmanned, followed by the first piloted mission in 2021.
Friday's test flight came at a crucial time for U.S. spaceflight, which has recently suffered some high-profile setbacks. On Oct. 28 an unmanned Antares rocket exploded in a fireball shortly after liftoff from a NASA launchpad in Wallops Island, Virginia. Just three days later Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo space tourism rocket crashed during a test flight over the Mojave Desert, killing one of the two pilots aboard and seriously injuring the other.

More than 100 scientists said in an open letter the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in China.
In videos posted online, scientist He Jiankui defended what he said he had achieved - embryonic gene editing to help protect twin baby girls born this month from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
“Pandora’s box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before it’s too late,” the scientists said in their letter, a copy of which was posted by the Chinese news website the Paper.
“The biomedical ethics review for this so-called research exists in name only. Conducting direct human experiments can only be described as crazy,” the approximately 120 scientists said in the Chinese-language letter.
Yang Zhengang, a Fudan University professor, told Reuters he signed the letter because gene editing was “very dangerous”.
China’s Genetics Society and the Chinese Society for Stem Cell Research said in a statement He had acted as an “individual” and his work posed “tremendous safety risks for the research subjects”.
“We believe the research led by He is strongly against both the Chinese regulations and the consensus reached by the international science community,” the two groups said in a statement posted online.

He, who is due to speak at a summit on human genome editing at the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Shenzhen Harmonicare Hospital, listed on China’s online clinical trial registry as having given ethical approval for He’s experiment, denied having ever taken part in any clinical operations relating to “gene-edited babies”.
The signatures on the online form were suspected of having been forged and “no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”, Hong Kong-listed Harmonicare Medical Holdings said in a statement.
‘VERY SHOCKED’
The Southern University of Science and Technology, where He holds an associate professorship, also said it had been unaware of the research project and that He had been on leave without pay since February.
The Shenzhen City Science and Innovation Committee, a municipal fund which was also listed on the clinical trial registry as having backed the trial, said in a statement on Monday it had never been involved in the project.
Xu Nanping, vice minister of China’s science and technology ministry, told reporters he was “very shocked” on hearing He’s claim, adding that such work had been prohibited since 2003.
Details of the case were still unclear, Xu said.
“We don’t know if this work is real or fake. If it’s real, then this is certainly banned in China.”
The official Xinhua news agency said ethics could not be ignored.
“Scientific exploration is never-ending ... but this does not mean that the morals of science can be abandoned or that ethical standards can be ignored,” the news agency said in a comment posted on social media.
The National Health Commission said on Monday it was “highly concerned” and had ordered provincial health officials “to immediately investigate and clarify the matter”.
The government’s medical ethics committee in Shenzhen said it was investigating the case, as was the Guangdong provincial health commission, according to Southern Metropolis Daily, a state media outlet.
The committee organizing the Hong Kong conference where He is due to speak - the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing - said in a statement on Monday it had only just been informed of He’s work on the genes of the twin girls.
“Our goal is to help ensure that human genome editing research be pursued responsibly,” the committee said.

SAN DIEGO – NASA's new Orion spacecraft returned to dry land in Southern California after a test flight that ended with a plunge into the Pacific Ocean.
A Navy ship, the USS Anchorage, delivered the capsule to Naval Base San Diego and unloaded the 11-foot-tall cone around 10 p.m. Monday.
Orion made an unmanned flight Friday that carried it 3,600 miles above Earth to test the spacecraft's systems before it carries astronauts on deep space missions. During re-entry into the atmosphere, the spacecraft endured speeds of 20,000 mph and temperatures near 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
It parachuted into the ocean about 600 miles southwest of San Diego, where the ship picked it up.
NASA and contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. assisted in Orion's recovery.
The spacecraft may one day carry astronauts to Mars, but its next trip will be on a truck that will carry it back to Cape Canaveral, Florida, in time for Christmas.
The next Orion flight, also unmanned, is four years away, and crewed flights at least seven years away given present budget constraints. But the Orion team — spread across the country and on the ocean, is hoping Friday's triumphant splashdown will pick up the momentum.
During the flight test, all 11 parachutes deployed and onboard computers withstood the intense radiation of the Van Allen belts surrounding Earth. Everything meant to jettison away did so as Orion soared into space. It landed just a mile from its projected spot off Mexico's Baja Peninsula.

He Jiankui, who shocked the scientific community last year by announcing the birth of twins whose genes had allegedly been altered to confer immunity to HIV, was also fined 3 million yuan ($430,000), Xinhua news agency said.
He was sentenced by a court in Shenzhen for ""illegally carrying out the human embryo gene-editing intended for reproduction"", Xinhua said.
The news agency said a third gene-edited baby was born as a result of He's experiments, which had not previously been confirmed.
The scientist announced in November last year that the world's first gene-edited babies -- twin girls -- had been born that same month after he altered their DNA to prevent them from contracting HIV by deleting a certain gene under a technique known as CRISPR.
The claim shocked scientists worldwide, raising questions about bioethics and putting a spotlight on China's lax oversight of scientific research.
Amid the outcry, He was placed under police investigation, the government ordered a halt to his research work and he was fired by his Chinese university.
Gene-editing for reproductive purposes is illegal in most countries. China's health ministry issued regulations in 2003 prohibiting gene-editing of human embryos, though the procedure is allowed for ""non-reproductive purposes"".

128,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/nasa-declares-international-space-station-open-for-business-including-private-astronaut-visits/,"At an event on Friday, NASA laid out its plans for making the International Space Station a hub for commercial activity in low Earth orbit. The agency has long planned to make the ISS a key anchor point for helping private business operate in space.
“We’re here because the International Space Station is now open for business,” NASA lead spokesperson Stephanie Schierholz said at the conference outset. Twenty companies joined NASA officials onstage to launch this new commercial ability and discuss the opportunities and plan.
Part of the plan includes allowing private astronauts to visit and stay on the ISS, traveling on U.S. vehicles. It also includes allowing private business activities to take place on the ISS, including “in-space manufacturing,” marketing activities, healthcare research “and more,” NASA says.
NASA articulated a five-part plan that it says “doesn’t conflict” with government and public sector use of the ISS, but that stands to allow creative and varied revenue-generating opportunities for private actors. NASA’s goal overall is to become “one of many” users of the ISS and low Earth orbit facilities, the agency said, and this should lead to benefits for tax payers, too.
Here’s NASA’s five-part plan, as described at a high level today:
- Part one – NASA created an International Space Station Commercial Use Policy. It provides an initial supply or quota of resources, including crew time, and cargo launch and return capabilities for purchase by private companies.
- Part two – Private astronauts can visit for up to two short durations per year, beginning early as 2020. Missions will be privately funded, dedicated commercial space flight and will have to use U.S. spacecraft (including those being certified by the NASA crew space travel program, like SpaceX’s Crew Dragon). NASA will lay out pricing for use of life support, crew supply, storage and data.
- Part three – The forward part of ISS Node 2 Harmony module is available as the first element of commercial destination. They characterized this as an initial step toward future commercial habitable modules in space. There’s a request for proposals coming on June 14 and NASA will select a first customer to award the port’s development by end of this fiscal year.
- Part four – NASA is developing a plan to stimulate long-term commercial demand, and it’s starting by studying space manufacturing and regenerative medicine in particular. The agency is asking for white papers by June 15 and proposals by July 28.
- Part five – NASA has a new white paper that articulates the minimum viable needs for long-term commercial operations in long-term orbit.
Lowering price for commercial transit is incredibly important to this plan overall, and that came up repeatedly; it seems like this is mostly a call to private entities to help solve these and other problems to make sure that commercialization is not only available, but also viable. Another piece of the plan is that long-term, over the next decade or so, private entities investing in the ISS can potentially replace it with a privately run space station, which would help address its eventual end-of-life replacement plans.
In an interview from April, TechCrunch’s Jon Shieber spoke to ISS National Lab Deputy Chief Scientist Dr. Michael Roberts about the station’s commercialization.
Dr. Roberts articulated some of the potential opportunities for private entities doing business on the ISS, including high interest in the “fundamental discovery” of areas like preclinical testing or drug delivery mechanisms in the pharmaceutical industry, for instance. In the manufacturing industry, Dr. Roberts pointed to private actors who are looking at ways to improve existing manufacturing practices, with the added benefit of operating in a zero-G and vacuum environment.
One of the key details here is a broadening of what’s allowed in terms of marketing activities done on the ISS: the U.S. NASA crew on board ISS can participate in some marketing activities (but essentially just behind the camera acting more as crew), and private astronauts will have a broader mandate, with much more flexibility in terms of what they can do in terms of advertising and promotion. So we could theoretically see a lot of Red Bull exxxttreemmmmeee!!! promotional activities, if this trends dystopian.
There are 50 private companies running experiments on the ISS right now, according to NASA, but this announcement is about laying a framework that could better formalize and scale that opportunity over time.

He Jiankui shocked the scientific community last year after announcing he had successfully altered the genes of twin girls born in November to prevent them contracting HIV.
He had told a human genome forum in Hong Kong there had been “another potential pregnancy” involving a second couple.
A provincial government investigation has since confirmed the existence of the second mother and that the woman was still pregnant, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
The expectant mother and the twin girls from the first pregnancy will be put under medical observation, an investigator told Xinhua.
The provincial government investigation found He had “forged ethical review papers” and “deliberately evaded supervision”, according to Xinhua. He had privately organised a project team that included foreign staff and used “technology of uncertain safety and effectiveness” for illegal human embryo gene-editing, it said.
Investigators told Xinhua the scientist was “pursuing personal fame” and used “self-raised funds” for the controversial experiment.
Eight volunteer couples – HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers – signed up to He’s trial, investigators found, with one couple later dropping out.
Details of the experiment – which has not been independently verified – triggered an immediate backlash from the global scientific community and the Chinese government ordered a halt to He’s research work days after it was publicly announced.
Such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China.
He will be “dealt with seriously according to the law”, Xinhua said.
Speaking at the genome summit in Hong Kong in November, He said he was “proud” of the experiment, given the stigma affecting Aids patients in the country.
The public outcry over his experiment also drew attention to the growing HIV epidemic in China, which has seen a drastic surge in new cases in recent years.
The scientist was educated at Stanford University and recruited back to China as part of Beijing’s “Thousand Talents Plan” to reverse brain drain, according to a copy of He’s resume published on the website of the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen.
SUSTech said in a statement on Monday it had terminated the researcher’s employment after earlier saying He’s work had “seriously violated academic ethics”.
He said the twins’ DNA was modified using Crispr, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
Experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also to future generations who inherit the same changes, and say there are too many scientific and technical uncertainties to permit clinical trials.
Following the storm sparked by He’s announcement, scientists have called for an international treaty on gene-editing.",0

When NASA launches its new big rocket for the first time — more than a year and a half from now, at the earliest — there will be no astronauts along for the ride.
In February, at the request of the Trump administration, NASA began studying whether it was possible to add crew for the first flight of its Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket under development for deep space missions.
On Friday, the space agency announced it would not. During a conference call with reporters, Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator, said the change was technically feasible, but that the additional cost, time and risks outweighed the benefits. “It really reaffirmed the baseline plan we have in place is the best way to go,” he said.
Putting astronauts on the first flight would have added $600 million to $900 million to the $24 billion price tag, Mr. Lightfoot said, and delayed the launch until probably the first half of 2020.
Including astronauts would have also required significant work, like adding a fully operational life-support system to the Orion crew capsule, where the astronauts would have been seated.
Even without that additional work, Mr. Lightfoot announced that the launch date has slipped again, to 2019 from the previous target of November 2018, because of various technical challenges and some bad luck. In February, a tornado struck the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, where pieces of the rocket are being built, damaging the roof and equipment.
“That really set us back in a big way,” said William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for the human exploration and operations directorate at NASA.
This month, a big dome-shaped piece at Michoud was badly damaged while being moved; it was to become the bottom of a liquid oxygen tank that will be used for testing. “It’s probably not repairable,” Mr. Gerstenmaier said. But there are additional domes, and Mr. Gerstenmaier said he did not expect that to add much to the delay.
The construction of the European Space Agency’s contribution to the rocket — a service module that will provide propulsion, power and supplies for the Orion capsule — is also behind schedule.
NASA will now follow its original plan. For the first flight, Orion is to fly thousands of miles beyond the moon during a three-week trip. Mr. Gerstenmaier said one advantage of a crewless mission is that it will allow more thorough testing, closer to the edge of the capabilities of the spacecraft. “We will push as hard as we can,” he said.
The second flight, the first with astronauts, will come about three years later. It is scheduled for August 2021, but will also likely be delayed.
The delays will add to the skepticism of those who think the Space Launch System and Orion will be obsolete by the time they get to the launchpad.
SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, is planning to finally launch this summer its long-delayed Falcon Heavy rocket. The Falcon Heavy is not as powerful as the Space Launch System, but with a $90 million price tag, far cheaper. The Space Launch System, which would launch only about once every two years, is estimated to cost $1 billion per mission.
Blue Origin, a rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also developing a large rocket called New Glenn, which may begin launching as soon as 2020.
The Trump administration’s preliminary budget proposal for 2018 keeps NASA’s financing level almost unchanged, while it includes deep cuts to many other agencies. The administration has not offered many details of its plans for NASA in the coming years.
At a symposium in Washington this month about efforts to speed the development of much cheaper, fully reusable rockets, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has advised President Trump on various issues including space, described the Space Launch System as less capable than the Saturn 5 rocket that took astronauts to the moon in 1969, yet far more expensive.
“The handwriting is on the wall,” Mr. Gingrich said. “Those kinds of programs are going to look stupid.”",1

The first 12-month mission to the International Space Station may launch in 2015, according to Russian media reports.
Under the plan, two astronauts — one Russian and one American — would blast off in March 2015 on an experimental endurance mission that's twice as long as current space station stays, officials with Russia's Federal Space Agency (known as Roscosmos) said Tuesday (Oct. 3).
""The principal decision has been made, and we just have to coordinate the formalities,"" said Alexei Krasnov, head of manned space missions at Roscosmos, according to Russian news agency Ria Novosti. ""If the mission proves to be effective, we will discuss sending year-long missions to ISS on a permanent basis.""
Krasnov added that the space station's partner agencies have already devised a scientific program for the long-duration mission, Ria Novosti reported. [Most Extreme Human Spaceflight Records]
Krasnov did not name the two astronauts who will launch on the marathon mission in the Ria Novosti report. Russia's Interfax news agency reported in August, however, that the NASA crewmember will likely be Peggy Whitson, who stepped down recently as the agency's chief astronaut in order to rejoin its active spaceflying ranks.
A year-long stay aboard the orbiting lab could help lay the groundwork for manned missions beyond low-Earth orbit, by allowing scientists to study how long-term spaceflight affects the human body.
That objective may be of great interest to NASA, which is currently working to send astronauts to destinations in deep space. In 2010, President Barack Obama directed the agency to get people to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025, then on to the vicinity of Mars by the mid-2030s.
According to some mission concepts, a manned roundtrip journey to Mars would take about two years to complete.
While nobody has yet resided aboard the International Space Station for a complete year, such a long orbital stay is not unprecedented. Cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, a medical doctor, lived aboard Russia's Mir space station for 438 consecutive days during a mission that began in January 1994 and ended in March 1995.
Polyakov's flight helped Russian scientists assess the physiological impacts of long-term spaceflight. But more recently, the nation took an in-depth look at the psychological stresses a marathon mission might impose.
In June 2010, six volunteers representing Russia, Europe and China embarked on the Russian-run Mars500 mission, a simulation that aimed to recreate the isolation and mental stress of a trip to the Red Planet. They emerged from the Moscow experimental complex in November 2011 after 520 days.
The $100 billion International Space Station is a partnership involving NASA, Roscosmos and the space agencies of Europe, Japan and Canada. Construction began in 1998, and the orbiting lab has been continuously occupied since November 2000.
Three astronauts currently reside aboard the station. They will be joined by three more spaceflyers in a few weeks, rounding out the current Expedition 33 to its full complement of six crewmembers.",1

NASA is planning to launch a test mission for its newest space capsule designed to eventually bring humans deeper into space than ever before. But the bold test flight, scheduled for Dec. 4, doesn't come without risks.
The space agency is sending its first Orion space capsule thousands of miles above Earth for the first time, and officials expect to retrieve it again when it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean. While the capsule will be unmanned during the test, it doesn't mean that people won't be intimately involved with some of the riskiest aspects of the mission. Officials will need to be on hand to fish Orion out of the Pacific Ocean after splashdown — a particularly risky aspect of the mission for the people involved.
""The environment in the open ocean is a hazardous environment in and of itself,"" Jeremy Graeber, recovery director for the test flight, said during a news conference. ""Nominally, the vehicle coming down should not pose any threats to the recovery forces, but it's a test flight, so there are systems that we are not 100 percent sure we know what position they're in once we're splashed down. We have high confidence that they'll be in great shape, but we've prepared ourselves in case there are some issues."" [Step-by-Step Guide for NASA's 1st Orion Spacecraft Test Flight]
Specifically, the propellant, ammonia and radiating elements of the craft used for telemetry could pose a hazard once back on Earth, but officials are prepared to handle those situations should they arise, Graeber added. The various teams working on the test flight will be in communication so that everyone remains safe.
During the Dec. 4 test, called Exploration Flight Test-1, Orion — which was built for NASA by Lockheed Martin — will launch to space atop a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rocket. The unmanned space capsule will then make two orbits of Earth, flying about 3,600 miles above the planet — close to 15 times higher than the orbit of the International Space Station.
When Orion hits the planet's atmosphere during re-entry, the spacecraft will be speeding at about 20,000 mph, according to NASA. The capsule's huge heat shield, the biggest of its kind ever made, will be put to the test during the re-entry. Officials will also test the spacecraft's huge parachute system used to slow down the descent of Orion after it comes through the atmosphere.
All in all, the Orion test flight should take about 4.5 hours. The test's 2-hour-and-39-minute launch window opens at 7:05 a.m. EST on Dec. 4. Splashdown should happen at about 11:29 a.m. EST if all goes according to plan.
Officials working with NASA are hoping to gather a wealth of data during the test, to see what kind of environments astronauts and the machinery protecting them might experience during a trip to space that takes them far from low-Earth orbit, where the space station is positioned.
Scientists and engineers want to test how key systems on Orion work during this test. Eventually, NASA officials hope that modified versions of Orion will take humans to deep-space destinations like an asteroid, and even Mars. Engineers working with the computers onboard Orion hope to see how the instruments behave when they're exposed to high amounts of radiation outside Earth's protective atmosphere.
""We do have radiation sensors on board, for example, so we're actually measuring different parts of the vehicle for what we're seeing, what the environment is inside,"" said Mark Geyer, Orion program manager. ""We have 1,200 sensors, and a lot of those are loads, so they measure the impact loads when we land [and during] ascent. We'll get acoustic data inside and out, so we know how loud it is — those kinds of things. A lot of that is for the vehicle, but it's also to understand what the environment for the crew is going to be.""
People on Earth will have a firsthand view of how Orion is doing throughout the test. The spacecraft will fly to space complete with cameras that should send information back to Earth throughout the test flight.",1
133,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS24146821220141202,"As NASA prepares for the debut test flight of the first spaceship in more than 40 years to carry astronauts beyond Earth, a fleet of privately owned vehicles is in development to take over transportation services to and from orbits closer to home.
Whether heading to the International Space Station, which flies about 260 miles above the planet, or other destinations, the journeys begin with rocket rides that have enough muscle to counteract Earth’s gravity and get their cargo traveling at speeds of at least 17,500 mph to achieve orbit.
Click here to view the embedded video.
NASA, for example, is using the biggest booster in the U.S. fleet, a Delta 4 Heavy, to shoot its Orion deep-space capsule as far as 3,600 miles from Earth during a test flight scheduled for Thursday. The key point of the test is to get Orion moving at about 20,000 mph before it slams into Earth’s atmosphere to test its heat shield.
Even suborbital spaceships, such as Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo and XCOR Aerospace’s Lynx space place, rely on rocket power to leave the atmosphere, though gravity quickly pulls them back to Earth. They don’t necessarily have to launch from land, however.
SpaceShipTwo, for example, is carried by airplane and released mid-air to fire its rocket, a design also used by the experimental X-15 space plane in the 1960s. Air-launching uses smaller rockets than those needed for similar ground-based flights, eliminates the need for expensive launch pads and opens options for launch sites, since the planes can take off from commercial runways.
More diverse are the spacecraft designs the companies have chosen, reflecting not only different technical solutions to the challenges of flying people beyond Earth, but also their alternative visions of the future.
FORM DICTATES FUNCTION
NASA preceded its so-called Commercial Crew development effort with a program to buy flights for space station cargo. Two U.S. supply lines are now running, though one operator, Orbital Sciences Corp, is regrouping after a launch accident last month. The other company flying cargo for NASA is California-based Space Exploration Technologies, owned and run by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk.
From the start, SpaceX designed its Dragon capsule to not only fly cargo, but also crew. “Cargo doesn’t need windows,” Musk quipped before the capsule’s first flight to the space station in 2012. Upgrades are underway to add life support equipment, seating and an escape system for crew, but SpaceX has even grander ambitions for its gumdrop-shaped Dragon. It is designed to fly people to Mars.
“The long-term ambition of SpaceX is to develop the technologies to establish a self-sustaining civilization on Mars … Wings and runways don’t really work if you’re going somewhere other than Earth,” Musk said at a Massachusetts Institute of Technology symposium in September.
Boeing, too, chose a capsule design for its planned space taxi, known as the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100. “The conical shape is inherently stable as we re-enter the atmosphere,” Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of Crew and Mission Systems, said in an interview with Reuters.
The capsule, which parachutes to a splashdown in the ocean or a touchdown on land, is intended to improve astronaut safety, added Ferguson, a former NASA space shuttle pilot and commander.
Boeing plans to modify the CST-100 if it wins a second NASA solicitation, currently underway, to fly cargo to the station. Cargo and crew would fly separately.
“I lived through the (space shuttle) Columbia accident in 2003 and one of the conclusions … was that that including the payload with the people was not the wisest choice. We carried 50,000 pounds of payload (on the shuttle), which was incredible, and up to seven people. But to make the systems safe to carry passengers, you have to make a fairly large vehicle. We think it is a much better approach to have the people and the cargo travel in different vehicles,” he said.
THINGS WITH WINGS
Capsules may be simpler to fly and cheaper to build, but they do have limitations. Sierra Nevada’s winged Dream Chaser, for example, resembles a miniature space shuttle, with an aerodynamically shaped body and wings so it can fly back from space, rather than make a ballistic plunge through the atmosphere like capsules.
“We come back with a significantly lower g-force during re-entry,” said Sierra Nevada Vice President Mark Sirangelo, referring to “gravity force” or a measure of acceleration.
“We’re about 2 gs and most capsules are 4- to 6. That protects returning experiments and crew,” Sirangelo said in an interview.
Like the space shuttle, Dream Chaser is designed for runway, not water, landings, though its small size means it can touch down on most commercial runways anywhere in the world.
“The idea of being able to come home to Ellington Field in Houston with an experiment from the space station for Texas Medical Center and have them take if off the vehicle and get it in their labs in a half-hour is very useful,” Sirangelo said.
Sierra Nevada currently is protesting NASA’s decision to proceed with a final round of development funds and flight services contracts to SpaceX and Boeing. A decision by the U.S. Government Accountability Office is due by Jan. 5. NASA also has an unfunded agreement to work with Jeff Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin.
In the meantime, Sierra Nevada is pursuing other contracts, including additional station resupply work for NASA that also is drawing bids from SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Boeing and possibly other contenders.
“We call Dream Chaser a ‘space utility vehicle’ for a reason. It can accomplish multiple purposes from the same core design, like an AC-130 aircraft. We can do repair missions, change altitudes. Capsules can’t do that very easily. We can do construction, like the space shuttle did to build the space station. We can be an independent or co-dependent lab and stay in orbit for one year or longer conducting experiments. From the same basic design, we can contemplate all these missions,” Sirangelo said.
Sierra Nevada already may have landed one customer. Paul Allen’s Stratolaunch Systems, which is building a massive airplane to serve as an airborne rocket-launching platform, announced last month it is considering buying a smaller version of Dream Chaser for commercial passenger spaceflights. The space plane would be attached to the Stratolaunch mothership for a ride into the atmosphere and then released to fire its own rocket engines and catapult it into space. The system could be used to fly people to and from orbit, as well as for sub-orbital hops, including taking off and landing in different locations, so called “point-to-point” travel. That’s a service that Virgin Galactic, another space tourism startup owned by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, would like to offer as well.
For now, Virgin Galactic’s six-passenger, two-pilot space plane, called SpaceShipTwo, will be limited to sub-orbital flights that originate from and return to the same location. The company’s first vehicle was destroyed during a fatal test flight in Mojave, Calif., on Oct. 31. The second vehicle is under construction. Point-to-point suborbital travel would require a different design, such as a blunter shape to better handle the higher speeds and heat of atmospheric re-entry, and a more powerful rocket engine.
RISK AND REWARD
Until the accident, SpaceShipTwo was on track to begin the world’s first commercial passenger spaceflight service in 2015 – 11 years after the prototype SpaceShipOne won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for demonstrating private manned spaceflight.
Coincidentally, it was 11 years after Wilbur and Orville Wright flew the world’s first powered airplane in 1903 that a paying passenger sat in the open cockpit of a boat-shaped Benoist XIV biplane for a ride across Florida’s Tampa Bay, the debut flight of the country’s first commercial airliner.
“If you could have had a conversation with that person who bought the first ride and said, ‘In your lifetime, you’re going to be riding in air-conditioned comfort at 35,000 feet, traveling .8 Mach, watching a movie and talking to friends on the ground,’ that guy would have said, ‘What’s a movie?’ The telephone, the jet … none of that had been invented, but all of it came into being very, very quickly after the airplane,” said Stu Witt, the chief executive and general manager of the Mojave Air and Space Port.
So is commercial spaceflight similarly primed?
“You put enough humans with brains and eyes and ears and senses in new environments and somebody is going to think of something we haven’t thought of. The fashion industry will change. The entertainment industry will change. Something will come out of it that you and I shouldn’t even be silly enough to try and forecast,” he said.

134,https://www.france24.com/en/20181126-china-scientist-claims-worlds-first-gene-edited-babies,"A scientist in China claims to have created the world?s first genetically-edited babies, in a potentially ground-breaking and controversial medical first.
Chinese university professor He Jiankui posted a video on YouTube saying that the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had had their DNA altered to prevent them from contracting HIV.
The professor, who was educated at Stanford in the US and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said their DNA was modified using CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
The development emerged Sunday in an article published by industry journal the MIT Technology Review, which referenced medical documents posted online by He's research team at the Southern University of Science and Technology to recruit couples for the experiments.
He's video then went online, prompting a heated debate among the scientific community, including from experts who cast doubt over the claimed breakthrough, and others who decried it as a modern form of eugenics.
He said the babies, known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"" although they are not their real names, were born through regular IVF but using an egg which was specially modified before being inserted into the womb.
""Right after sending her husband's sperm into her egg, an embryologist also sent in CRISPR/Cas9 protein and instructions to perform a gene surgery intended to protect the girls from future HIV infection,"" he said.
The claims come ahead of a conference of world experts in Hong Kong on Tuesday, where He is expected to reveal more details.
But there is as yet no independent verification of his claims, which have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal -- an omission that the scientist's critics have seized on.
- 'Highly problematic' -
The MIT Technology Review warns that ""the technology is ethically charged because changes to an embryo would be inherited by future generations and could eventually affect the entire gene pool.""
Other scientists have also sounded caution.
Nicholas Evans, assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, said on Twitter that the claims were ?wild?.
""On a basic level, announcing the test through a YouTube video is a highly problematic form of scientific practice, as it steps aside the vetting processes on which a lot of scientific advance relies, such as peer review,"" he told AFP.
""We?ve been talking about genetic engineering of embryos for a while... what is a bit more revolutionary is that these children were allegedly engineered to provide resistance to a disease. That?s a new step forward, and where a lot of peril is.""
The issue of editing human DNA is extremely controversial, and only allowed in the US in laboratory research -- although US scientists said last year that they had successfully edited the genetic code of piglets to remove dormant viral infections.
But this is not the first time Chinese researchers have experimented with human embryo technology, and last September scientists at Sun Yat-sen University in China used an adapted version of gene-editing to correct a disease-causing mutation in human embryos.
Sam Sternberg, assistant professor in biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia University, questioned the whole premise of He's research, noting that it was not aimed at fixing a life-threatening condition -- like a genetic disease for example.
""Missing from the video is the fact that edits were made to embryos that do NOT have HIV. Changes risk/benefit big-time,"" he tweeted.
""This breaking news story sure is an absolute bombshell for the #GeneEditSummit in Hong Kong this week. No doubt countless speakers are scrambling to update slides as we speak.""
He Jiankui did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP.
Neither was there any response from queries to the organisers of the Hong Kong conference, and it is not clear whether they were aware of He?s work.
In a pre-recorded video on the conference?s website, biologist and chair of the international summit David Baltimore said: ""We have never done anything that will change the genes of the human race, and we have never done anything that will have effects that will go on through the generations.""

135,https://www.france24.com/en/20181003-nasa-skeptical-sabotage-theory-after-mystery-iss-leak,"NASA expressed doubts Wednesday over a theory floated in Russia that a tiny hole that caused an air leak on the International Space Station was the result of sabotage.
The breach detected on August 29-30 in a Russian space craft docked at the orbiting station was not the result of a manufacturing defect, according to the Russian space agency, which says it is investigating the possibility that it was drilled maliciously.
But NASA, the US space agency, countered in a statement that ruling out defects ""does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent.""
Russian space agency Roscosmos immediately launched an investigation into the hole, and its chief official Dmitry Rogozin went on television days later to say it could have been the result of foul play either back on Earth or by astronauts in space.
""Where it was made will be established by a second commission, which is at work now,"" said Rogozin, a former Russian deputy prime minister who was placed under US sanctions over the Ukraine crisis in 2014.
The Russian daily Kommersant reported that an investigation at home was probing the possibility that US astronauts deliberately drilled the hole in order to get a sick colleague sent back home -- something Russian officials later denied.
""NASA and Roscosmos are both investigating the incident to determine the cause,"" NASA said on Wednesday.
ISS astronauts are planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information on the hole, which was quickly sealed.
An astronaut and cosmonaut are due to travel to the ISS on October 11 aboard a Russian Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine plans to meet Rogozin - their first in-person encounter -- when he attends the launch.
The six-person ISS crew includes two Russians, two Americans and a German representing the European Space Agency.

137,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/science/nasa-sees-capsule-test-as-a-step-toward-mars.html,"NASA Sees Capsule Test as a Step Toward Mars
For the first time since Apollo 17 returned from the moon in 1972, NASA is scheduled to loft an astronaut capsule on Thursday to soar beyond low Earth orbit.
No one will be aboard this flight test of the new capsule, Orion, but NASA hopes it is the first step toward human exploration of the solar system, including an eventual landing on Mars. Orion’s first manned mission is planned for the early 2020s.
“Thursday is the beginning of that journey,” Mark Geyer, Orion’s program manager, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Orion, which looks like a larger version of the cone-shaped Apollo capsule, is sitting atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Liftoff is scheduled for 7:05 a.m. Thursday, minutes after sunrise. In case of bad weather, the launching can be pushed back by up to two hours and 39 minutes.
The rocket’s second stage should push the 11-foot-long Orion into an elliptical orbit that reaches 3,600 miles above the Earth’s surface on its second orbit. (By contrast, the International Space Station is about 250 miles from Earth.)
Orion will then re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere at 20,000 miles per hour, close to the speeds of a capsule returning from the moon, and temperatures on its heat shield will approach 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
At the end of the four-and-a-half-hour flight, it will splash down in the Pacific Ocean, about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California, and will be pulled from the water by an amphibious Navy ship, the Anchorage. The capsule will then be trucked back to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for closer examination.
The flight, estimated to cost $375 million, will provide a full-scale test of the performance of Orion’s parachutes, heat shield and other systems, with 1,200 sensors recording data.
“We expect it to go fine, but you really have to fly it to test it out,” Mr. Geyer said.
While the capsule will not be carrying any people, it will be taking mementos and artifacts. They include a small sample of lunar soil, part of a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil and several artistic works, like poems by Maya Angelou and a recording of the Mars movement from Gustav Holst’s “The Planets.”
Also aboard will be some items from “Sesame Street”: Cookie Monster’s cookie, Ernie’s rubber ducky and Grover’s cape, part of a collaboration between NASA and the children’s television program to promote science and math education.
After the flight test, NASA’s progress for future astronaut missions will be slow, hemmed in by tight federal budgets and competing visions of the agency’s future. Orion’s next flight, also without people aboard, is not expected until 2018, and the first ride for astronauts would not occur until at least 2021.
“We feel really fortunate to be in the budget plan, a bipartisan agreement on the budget plan, and our job is to execute to that plan,” Mr. Geyer said. “Yeah, I wish we could go faster, but I think this is a good plan.”
The next destination is also unclear. NASA is pursuing the idea of capturing a small asteroid and taking it to the neighborhood of the moon, and astronauts would then fly in Orion to the asteroid to take a look. NASA officials contend that this “asteroid redirect” mission would be within its budget and would develop technologies necessary for the eventual trip to Mars.
Some skeptics have questioned whether Orion, originally part of a program started under President George W. Bush to send astronauts back to the moon, is even necessary, or a waste of billions of dollars.
The Obama administration canceled Orion and the entire moon program as too expensive and too far behind schedule. But many members of Congress disagreed, and NASA revived a stripped-down version of Orion to be used as a lifeboat for the International Space Station, then resumed a design very close to what had been canceled.
NASA also started work on a heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System that will carry Orion on future launchings. Together, the rocket and the capsule are estimated to cost $19 billion to $22 billion.
Some House Republicans have pushed to revive plans to return to the moon, but have not proposed funds to build a lander.
Meanwhile, NASA is financing the development of two other capsules, built by Boeing and the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, better known as SpaceX, for taking astronauts to and from the space station beginning in 2017, part of what the space agency calls its commercial crew program.
“Orion won’t survive regular commercial crew flight,” James A. M. Muncy, a space policy consultant who advocates a more entrepreneurial approach to human spaceflight, wrote in an email interview.
Boeing officials have maintained that their capsule is designed only for taking people to low Earth orbit, but Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, has in the past promoted his Dragon capsule, developed at a much lower cost than Orion, as a possible replacement for Orion for trips to deep space.
After the first unmanned Dragon test flight in 2010, Mr. Musk said he hoped NASA would at least consider the possibility. “Dragon has arguably more capability than Orion,” he said then. “Basically, anything Orion can do, Dragon can do.”
But officials at NASA and Lockheed Martin, the builder of Orion, say it is specifically designed for longer missions, up to 21 days for four astronauts.
The spacecraft also needs to carry several times as much oxygen, food and water as on a trip to low Earth orbit and provide practical amenities for the astronauts. “It has a bathroom,” Josh B. Hopkins, the space exploration architect at Lockheed Martin, said in an interview.
Orion could take part in an eventual monthslong trip to Mars as part of a larger spacecraft that included more living space for the astronauts.",1

* Russia holds monopoly on space station crew rides
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 19 (Reuters) - NASA plans to spend $1.6 billion over the next two years bolstering industry efforts to develop space taxis, officials said on Monday.
The U.S. space agency will be looking for complete systems -- launchers, spaceships, mission operations and ground support -- to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station by the middle of the decade, a draft solicitation released on Monday shows.
The money will supplement investments that private companies are making to develop commercial space transportation services.
President Barack Obama has requested $850 million for NASA’s so-called Commercial Crew initiative for the year beginning Oct. 1. The Senate Appropriations Committee last week offered $500 million.
With the U.S. space shuttles retired, the United States is dependent on Russia to fly its astronauts to the space station, a $100 billion project of 16 nations that orbits about 225 miles (360 km) above Earth. Russia charges more than $50 million a person, including training and support services.
A Russian cargo ship failed last month to reach orbit after a launch accident, exposing the vulnerability of having only one way for crew to fly to the space station. The Progress rocket, which was carrying a cargo capsule of food and fuel, and the Soyuz booster that carries crew use nearly identical upper-stage motors.
China, the only other country that has flown people in orbit, is not a member of the space station program.
“Right now, we have a single-string failure for a $100 billion national lab,” NASA’s commercial spaceflight development director, Phil McAlister, said at an industry briefing in Florida on Friday, referring to the reliance on one option to transport crew to the space station.
“Every year we do not have a commercial crew capability, the station is at risk,” he said.
NASA expects to award multiple contracts for the third phase of its commercial crew development work next year. The contracts would begin in July 2012 and conclude in April 2014.
The solicitation is due to be released before the end of the year.
NASA is now supporting spaceship development by four firms -- Boeing BA.N, Space Exploration Technologies, Sierra Nevada Corp and Blue Origin, a privately funded aerospace company set up by Amazon's AMZN.O Jeff Bezos. The contracts are worth a combined $269 million.
Also on Monday, NASA added $46 million to its current commercial crew program, allotting an extra $25.6 million for Sierra Nevada and $20.6 million for Boeing for additional work on their spaceships. (Editing by Kevin Gray and Peter Cooney)",1

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – NASA took another shot at launching its new Orion spacecraft Friday, a day after gusty wind and sticky valves held up the critical test flight.
The unmanned rocket holding Orion was poised to blast off at sunrise, although weather was threatening again to interfere. This time, rain and clouds were in the forecast; the wind, while stiffer, was expected to blow in a more favorable direction. Forecasters put the odds of acceptable conditions at 50-50, as a nearly full moon glowed in the sky well before dawn.
Orion will orbit the world twice on this inaugural flight so NASA can wring out the riskiest systems before putting astronauts on board. Future missions will aim for asteroids and, ultimately, Mars. This time, the spacecraft will shoot for a high point of 3,600 miles, farther than any spacecraft built for humans has gone since the Apollo moon program.
The entire mission will last just 4 1/2 hours, culminating with an old-style splashdown in the Pacific. NASA needs that extra-high altitude to gain enough momentum to re-enter at a speed of 20,000 mph and submit the capsule's massive heat shield to 4,000-degree temperatures.
Roads leading into the Kennedy Space Center were less congested for this second time around. Nonetheless, the hotels remained packed, the press site was jammed and NASA still anticipated a full house reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. Many of the estimated 27,000 guests were expected to return.
Thursday's countdown paused repeatedly in the final few minutes as the wind exceeded safety limits before the valve trouble scrubbed the day's launch. Engineers spent the remainder of the day trying to understand why two fuel valves in the first-stage booster engines behaved so sluggishly. The problem had been detected before on another rocket and officials were confident it could be overcome.
Lockheed Martin Corp., which is conducting the $370 million test flight for NASA, opted for the Delta IV rocket this time given its heft. It's the most powerful unmanned rocket in the U.S. right now. To push Orion farther out on future flights, NASA is developing a megarocket known as Space Launch System or SLS.
The first Orion-SLS combo will fly around 2018, again without a crew. Astronauts are expected to climb aboard in 2021.
Dozens of astronauts, present and past, gathered at Kennedy Space Center for the historic send-off. One of them now leads NASA: Administrator Charles Bolden Jr.
Bolden called Mars ""the ultimate destination of this generation,"" but said his granddaughter thinks otherwise, telling him ""Don't get hung up on Mars because there are other places to go once we get there.""",1
141,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/29/gene-editing-babies-violation-chinese-law-says-official/,"A Chinese government official has declared the research of scientist He Jiankui, who said he created the world’s first gene-edited babies, a violation of Chinese law, and called for all related work to be halted.
“The genetically edited infant incident reported by media blatantly violated China’s relevant laws and regulations,” Xu Nanping, a vice-minister for science and technology, told Chinese state broadcaster CCTV Thursday evening. “It has also violated the ethical bottom line that the academic community adheres to. It is shocking and unacceptable.”
Earlier this week, national and local authorities said investigations had been launched into Mr He’s work and conduct after videos and interviews from him and his lab were published on Youtube, and by two prominent Western media outlets.
The shocking claims have yet to be independently verified by experts and published in a journal, though if true, would represent a monumental leap in biomedical research.
Mr He spoke Wednesday in Hong Kong, defending his work at a global industry summit and describing years of secret, self-funded research. He also revealed a second woman was potentially pregnant as a result of his work, though had suspended further work at the moment given international outcry over the disclosure of his research.
So far, he’s claimed to have produced two gene-edited baby girls, dubbed “Lulu” and “Nana”, whose DNA was altered to be more resistant to HIV.
All couples he recruited for this study had an HIV-positive father, and a non-infected mother. By using a method called Crispr-Cas9, Mr He was able to target specific blocks of DNA with pinpoint precision.
While the technology to change DNA has existed for decades, it has improved vastly in recent years allowing scientists to make very targeted changes. Still, that practice is surrounded by intense ethical debate, questions on the regulation of safety and is governed by laws in some countries; in the UK, it is illegal to gene edit human embryos over 14 days old.
In China, where scientists have forged ahead with astonishing speed, regulations are still catching up.
Globally speaking, the field is so new and cutting edge that experts simply don’t know the full impact and risk involved for a gene edited embryo as it develops into adulthood, and how changed DNA might pass into future generations.
In the future, such technology could be used to eradicate inherited illnesses, but it could also pave the way for “designer babies” engineered to have certain traits like hair colour or intelligence.
After news of Mr He’s work came to light earlier this week, Chinese scientists were quick to denounce it, as was his institution, the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen. Then university has said it wasn’t involved in the study, though documents available online about the work included the name of the institution.
US professor Michael Deem is also now under investigation by his institution, Rice University, for his involvement in Mr He’s research. Mr Deem advised Mr He’s graduate work at the university.
A non-governmental HIV/AIDS organisation, Baihaulin, has acknowledged that it helped Mr He spread the word to recruit participants for his trials, according to state media. Bai Hua, the founder of the group, hung up on repeated calls from the Telegraph on Thursday for comment.",0
142,https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/china-declares-crispr-babies-research-illegal/,"Chinese authorities have declared the work of He Jiankui, who shocked the scientific community by claiming he successfully created the world’s first gene-edited babies, an illegal decision in pursuit of “personal fame and gain.” Investigators have completed preliminary steps in a probe that began in November following He’s claims and say they will “seriously” punish the researcher for violations of the law, China’s official news agency Xinhua reported on Monday.
He, who taught at Shenzhen’s Southern University of Science and Technology, had led a team to research the gene-editing technique CRISPR since mid-2016 in attempts to treat cancers and other diseases. The incident drew significant attention to the professor’s own biotech startups that are backed by local and overseas investors.
The official probe shows that He fabricated ethics approvals which he used to recruit eight couples to participate in clinical procedures between March 2017 and November 2018. The attempt led to two pregnancies, including one that resulted in the birth of twins and the other embryo yet to be born. Five couples failed to achieve fertilization and one pair dropped out of the experiment.
He’s project has sparked a wave of criticism among scientists across the world. CRISPR is still dangerously unethical at this point for it may cause serious genetic damage. Some researchers have proposed a moratorium on CRISPR until more guidelines become clear while others call for developing safer and more ethical methods to propel the technology forward. Many countries, including the United States and China, prohibit gene-editing of human embryos for reproductive purposes.",0
143,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/health/china-gene-editing-babies-intl,"(CNN)Authorities in China say experiments which led to the birth of the world's first gene-edited babies broke the country's laws, state-run Xinhua news reported Monday.
In November, Chinese scientist He Jiankui sparked international outrage when he announced that twin girls -- Lulu and Nana -- had been born with modified DNA to make them resistant to HIV. He later claimed a second woman was pregnant as a result of the research.
On Monday, Xinhua appeared to confirm the existence of the second pregnancy, but did not give any further details.
Following He's initial announcement, China's National Health Commission ""immediately requested the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission to seriously investigate and verify"" the claims made by the scientist.
On Monday, investigators from Guangdong Province Health Commission said that ""the case has been initially identified as an explicitly state-banned human embryo-editing activity for reproductive purposes conducted by He Jiankui,"" Xinhua reported. The commission added that the scientist has conducted the work ""In pursuit of personal fame and fortune, with self-raised funds and deliberate evasion of supervision and private recruitment of related personnel.""
Procedures investigated
The authorities also believe He forged both ethical review documents and blood tests to circumvent a ban on assisted reproduction for HIV-positive patients, state media reported.
Questions emerged over the authenticity of He's ethical approval documents soon after the babies were revealed when one of the hospitals named in the paperwork denied any involvement in the procedures.
""We can ensure that the research wasn't conducted in our hospital nor were the babies born here,"" a Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital representative told CNN in November. The hospital confirmed that two of the doctors named in He's documents work at the hospital and suggested that an internal investigation was underway.
Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many countries, including the United States. In the UK, editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.
China has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, with the government bankrolling research into a number of world ""firsts,"" including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.
'A series of poor decisions'
Following the initial results of the investigation reported by Xinhua, Yalda Jamshidi, reader in Genomic Medicine at St George's, University of London, said the Chinese investigators appeared to confirm that the birth of the gene-edited twins were the result of ""a series of poor decisions.""
""Unsurprisingly, the experiments have been met with heavy criticism, particularly as the procedures used have not been tested for safety in humans, and were not carried out for any real medical need,"" Jamshidi said in an emailed statement.
""The report will hopefully set an example with appropriate legal and punitive actions to reassure the public and scientific community that gene editing, like all potentially new medical interventions, will only be allowed where they address a true medical need, and with appropriate ethical and regulatory oversight,"" the statement added.
But Dr Helen O'Neill, program director of Reproductive Science and Women's Health at University College London had a more muted response to the latest outcome.
""The reports do not shed much in the way of new light on the story. There is no further clarification on what measures will be taken to prevent this happening in future, nor what will be done as punishment for He Jiankui's lack of regard for policy, the patients and the scientific community.""
Authorities in China said He and any other people or institutions involved will be ""dealt with seriously according to the law, and if suspected of crimes, they will be handed over to the public security bureau,"" according to Xinhua.
""For the born babies and pregnant volunteers, Guangdong Province will work with relevant parties to perform medical observation and follow-up visits under the guidance of relevant state departments,"" Xinhua said, adding that born babies and pregnant volunteers will be monitored and followed-up with under the guidance of relevant state departments.",0
144,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/us/christina-koch-spaceflight-record-iss-scn-trnd,"(CNN)NASA astronaut Christina Koch was scheduled to take part in the first all-female spacewalk alongside Anne McClain on March 29, but it was scrapped due to spacesuit availability. Instead, Koch conducted her spacewalk alongside Nick Hague.
Now she has her eye on a different record: the longest single spaceflight by a woman.
Koch arrived on the International Space Station on March 14 for her first spaceflight mission. She will remain on the station until February 2020, according to NASA's new schedule.
Normally, astronauts stay on the station for six months.
Koch's mission will surpass that of Peggy Whitson, who spent 288 consecutive days in space, and end up just shy of the longest single spaceflight by a NASA astronaut: 340 days, set by Scott Kelly.
Koch shared her excitement about the extended mission on Twitter. ""One month down. Ten to go. Today the possibility has become reality: My mission is planned to be extended through a third Expedition onboard @Space_Station! Privileged to contribute my best every single day of it.""
NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan, arriving on the space station on July 20, will also enjoy an extended mission and return in spring 2020.
This comes on the heels of last week's announcement of the final results from NASA's Twins Study, examining the effects of long-term spaceflight on humans. Kelly's one-year mission in 2015 and 2016 provided invaluable insight about what the human body experiences in zero gravity. Last week, the agency said that more long-term missions would be planned to allow further study.
This helps NASA and its astronauts prepare for extended missions to the moon and, in the future, Mars.
""Astronauts demonstrate amazing resilience and adaptability in response to long duration spaceflight exposure,"" said Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of the Human Research Program at NASA's Johnson Space Center. ""This will enable successful exploration missions with healthy, performance-ready astronauts. NASA is looking to build on what we have learned with additional astronauts in space for more than 250 days. Christina's extended mission will provide additional data for NASA's Human Research Program and continue to support future missions to the Moon and Mars.""",1

He Jiankui shocked the scientific community last year after announcing he had successfully altered the genes of twin girls born in November to prevent them from contracting HIV.
He had told a human genome forum in Hong Kong that there had been ""another potential pregnancy"" involving a second couple.
A provincial government investigation has since confirmed the existence of the second mother and that the woman was still pregnant, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
The expectant mother and the twin girls from the first pregnancy will be put under medical observation, an investigator told Xinhua.
The provincial government probe found He had ""forged ethical review papers"" and ""deliberately evaded supervision,"" according to Xinhua.
He had ""privately"" organised a project team that included foreign staff and used ""technology of uncertain safety and effectiveness"" for illegal human embryo gene-editing, it said.
Investigators told Xinhua that the scientist was ""pursuing personal fame"" and used ""self-raised funds"" for the controversial experiment.
Eight volunteer couples -- HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers -- signed up to He's trial, investigators found, with one couple later dropping out.
- Immediate backlash -
Details of the experiment -- which has not been independently verified -- triggered an immediate backlash from the global scientific community and the Chinese government ordered a halt to He's research work days after it was publicly announced.
Such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China.
He will be ""dealt with seriously according to the law,"" and his case will be ""handed over to public security organs for handling,"" Xinhua said.
Speaking at the genome summit in Hong Kong in November, He said he was ""proud"" of altering the genes of the babies, given the stigma affecting AIDS patients in the country.
The public outcry over his experiment also drew attention to the growing HIV epidemic in China, which has seen a drastic surge in new cases in recent years.
The scientist was educated at Stanford University in the US and recruited back to China as part of Beijing's ""Thousand Talents Plan"" to reverse brain drain, according to a copy of He's resume published on the website of the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen.
SUSTech said in a statement Monday it had terminated the researcher's employment after earlier saying He's work had ""seriously violated academic ethics"".
He said the twins' DNA was modified using CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
Experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit the same changes, and say there are too many scientific and technical uncertainties to permit clinical trials.
Following the storm sparked by He's announcement, scientists have called for an international treaty on gene-editing.

The estranged wife of a NASA astronaut who claimed her spouse improperly accessed her bank account from space has been indicted on charges of lying to federal authorities.
Summer Worden, 44, whose claim would have possibly been the first accusation of a crime committed in space, made false statements to NASA's Office of the Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission, according a statement from U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick. A federal jury in Houston returned the two-count indictment in late February, but it was unsealed Monday.
Worden married Anne McClain, a decorated astronaut who was once set to be part of NASA's first all-female spacewalk, in 2014 and filed for divorce in 2018.
In 2019, Worden filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming McClain had stolen her identity while on a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station, although she saw no signs anyone had moved or used funds in the account, The New York Times reported. Worden's parents brought a separate complaint to NASA's Office of the Inspector General that described a ""highly calculated and manipulative campaign"" designed to win custody of the couple's child.
First alleged crime in space: NASA astronaut accused of accessing her estranged wife's bank account
""There’s unequivocally no truth to these claims. We’ve been going through a painful, personal separation that’s now unfortunately in the media,"" McClain said in a statement released on Twitter at the time. ""I appreciate the outpouring of support and will reserve comment until after the investigation. I have total confidence in the IG process.""
Through her lawyer, Rusty Hardin, McClain told The Times she had accessed the account but said she did so to ensure that the family's finances were in order and that there was enough money in the account to care for their child, who was born a year before they met. She said she was never told to stop using the account and continued to use the same password she had throughout the relationship.
The indictment says Worden maintained multiple accounts at USAA Federal Savings Bank and she shared access to those accounts ""with a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army on detail to NASA’s Johnson Space Center.""
She lied about when she opened the account that had allegedly been improperly accessed and when she reset her login credentials in a complaint filed with the FTC in March 19, 2019, according to the indictment. Worden also allegedly made another false statement in an interview with NASA's Office of the Inspector General in July.
Worden told The Times she mistakenly gave investigators the wrong date of her bank account’s opening but gave the correct information later.
She added that she had intended to change her password when she created the new account and did not believe it was appropriate for McClain to access her finances during a parenting dispute and divorce.
If convicted, Worden could face up to five years in prison on each count and a maximum fine of $250,000. She is expected to make an initial court appearance April 13.

American astronauts could be forced to fly on Russian spacecraft beyond 2017 if Congress continues to cut funding for private crewed vehicles, NASA chief Charles Bolden says.
On Tuesday (April 30), NASA announced that it will pay $70.7 million each for six more seats aboard Russian Soyuz space capsules. The $424 million deal keeps Americans launching to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz through 2016, with return and rescue services extending until June 2017.
Funding cuts to NASA's Commercial Crew Program have delayed the development of private American space taxis, making this latest deal with the Russians necessary, Bolden said. And future cuts could bring about the purchase of even more Soyuz seats, he added. [The Top 10 Private Spaceships]
[pullquote]
""Even this delayed availability will be in question if Congress does not fully support the President's fiscal year 2014 request for our Commercial Crew Program, forcing us once again to extend our contract with the Russians,"" Bolden wrote in a blog post Tuesday.
Filling the shuttle's shoes
NASA is encouraging the development of private American spaceships to fill the cargo- and crew-carrying void left by the 2011 retirement of the agency's iconic space shuttle fleet.
NASA signed billion-dollar deals with two companies — California-based SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp., which is headquarted in Virginia — to fly unmanned supply missions to the space station.
SpaceX has already completed two of its contracted 12 missions using its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket. Orbital successfully test-flew its Antares rocket for the first time last month and aims to launch a demonstration mission to the orbiting lab with Antares and its Cygnus spacecraft in the next few months.
But things are progressing more slowly on the crew-carrying side. NASA had hoped that at least one homegrown private spaceship would be ready to carry astronauts by 2015, but the timeline has slipped because Congress failed to fund commercial crew at the level President Barack Obama requested, Bolden said.
The Obama Administration asked for $850 million and $830 million for the program in its fiscal year 2012 and 2013 federal budget requests, respectively. But Congress eventually approved just $406 million and $489 million.
""If NASA had received the President's requested funding for this plan, we would not have been forced to recently sign a new contract with Roscosmos [the Russian Federal Space Agency] for Soyuz transportation flights,"" Bolden wrote.
Meeting the deadline
Bolden isn't alone in prodding Congress to approve the full $821 million for commercial crew in President Obama's fiscal year 2014 budget request, which was released last month.
""We strongly urge Congress to provide the necessary appropriations to keep the program on schedule,"" Commercial Spaceflight Federation president Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former NASA astronaut, said in a statement. ""In difficult economic times, extending the offshoring of American jobs to Russian rocket companies is not a practice the American taxpayers should support.""
If NASA does have to buy more Soyuz seats in the future, the price may well be higher than it is today. After all, the per-seat price went up $8 million in the last two years. (NASA paid $62.7 million per astronaut in its previous Soyuz deal, which was announced in March 2011.)
The three leading private contenders to fly NASA astronauts to and from the space station are SpaceX, aerospace giant Boeing and Colorado-based Sierra Nevada Corp.
SpaceX is developing a manned version of its Dragon capsule. Boeing is working on a capsule of its own, called the CST-100, while Sierra Nevada is building a space plane called Dream Chaser.",1

(CNN)A special treat is on the menu for NASA astronauts on the International Space Station on Monday -- lettuce. But this isn't just any lettuce. It's part of a crop of ""Outredgeous"" red romaine lettuce grown on the space station.
""Fresh food grown in the microgravity environment of space officially is on the menu for the first time for NASA astronauts,"" NASA said in a statement.
But it's not the first time food was grown on a space station, it made clear.
""For decades, NASA and other agencies have experimented with plants in space, but the results were always sent to earth for examination, rather than eaten,"" NASA said.
There was no word on whether crew members have been ""unofficially"" sneaking some space-grown snacks.
Yes, the astronauts get plenty of prepared foods shipped up by supply ships. But NASA needs to figure out how to grow food on spacecraft -- and on other planets -- for future deep space missions such as the one planned to Mars. The space agency plans to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s.
Besides, gardening is fun on Earth, and NASA said astronauts likely will use it as a recreational activity on long missions.
The lettuce was grown aeroponically--in an air or mist environment without soil--in the space station's Veggie plant growth system. Plants grown aeroponically require far less water and fertilizer, don't need pesticide, are much less prone to disease, and grow up to three times faster than plants grown in soil, NASA said.
The system was tested at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the plants were checked for safety. Still, half the crew's harvest will be sent back to Earth for more testing. And to be even safer, the astronauts will clean the lettuce with citric acid-based, food-safe sanitizing wipes before eating it.
The crew seems excited about the lettuce. Astronauts Scott Kelly and Kjell Lindgren took to Twitter to share images of their crop.
Kelly and Lindgren are the only two NASA astronauts on the space station now. The other crew members are Russians Gennady Padalka, Mikhail Kornienko, Oleg Kononenko and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui.
NASA didn't say if the other crew members would sample the lettuce, but Padalka and Kornienko will be busy with a spacewalk. They're installing devices on the hull of the station to help crew members be able to move around better on future spacewalks. They're also doing some window-washing -- cleaning residue off the windows of the Zvezda Service Module -- and working on the station's communications antennas.
Maybe Kelly and Lindgren will save them enough lettuce for at least a side salad.",1

NASA announced Friday it will open up the International Space Station (ISS) to tourists.
The U.S. space agency said it would open the space station for ""private astronaut missions"" by allowing two flights per year, each lasting a maximum of 30 days.
The trips will cost approximately $50 million, with NASA making a $35,000 profit per trip, according to CNBC.
The move comes as companies like Boeing and SpaceX develop capsules to take humans to the ISS, and NASA said that those two companies will take care of those tourists and any needs they may have.
The first planned private mission to the ISS is set for as early as 2020, the space agency said.
The ISS has been slowly moving in the direction of privatization, with NASA creating more and more deals with private companies to operate missions to the station.
The commercialization of the space station has been discussed thoroughly, with some saying it could help alleviate some of the costs incurred by the government for operating it, and could help spur a new business ecosystem in space.
Private companies will also have the opportunity to bid for new activities on the ISS, as NASA unveiled an initiative to ""enable commercial manufacturing and production and allow both NASA and private astronauts to conduct new commercial activities aboard the orbiting laboratory.
""In the long-term, NASA’s goal is to become one of many customers purchasing services from independent, commercial and free-flying habitable destinations in low-Earth orbit,"" the agency said in a press release.
About one-third of NASA's annual budget for the ISS goes toward operating costs, according to the Washington Post.Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Today, for the first time ever, astronauts aboard the International Space Station are going to eat vegetables that they grew in space in an area fittingly called Veggie.
The vegetables are grown out of little pillow-like packets in a system that was designed and tested by Madison, Wisc.-based Orbital Technologies Corp. The plants grow under red, blue and green LED light in an open-air environment (the veggies had to be tested before consumption to ensure there were no odd particles in the space air).
First on the space-vegetable menu is red romaine lettuce. Astronauts will eat half of the lettuce and bring the other half of the lettuce back to earth for further study, according to a statement from NASA about the space gardening. The crew is also growing flowers to see how they do in zero gravity, which could play a role in studying pollination of other items, including fruit.
Maintaining a garden in space will also keep astronauts happy. One of the less glamorous aspects of traveling in space is that you spend countless hours cramped up in a tiny space. ""Besides having the ability to grow and eat fresh food in space, there also may be a psychological benefit. The crew does get some fresh fruits or vegetables, such as carrots or apples, when a supply ship arrives at the space station. But the quantity is limited and must be consumed quickly,"" says Dr. Gioia Massa, the NASA scientist working on the vegetable project at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.",1

NASA scrubbed the eagerly-anticipated test flight of its new Orion spacecraft on Thursday morning after experiencing technical glitches.
The space agency is now planning to launch Orion at 7:05 a.m ET Friday.
Thursday's test flight suffered a series of delays. The launch, which was scheduled for 7:05 a.m ET, was initially pushed back while a nearby boat was removed from the launch area. Two further delays occurred when when wind conditions exceeded the limits set for the launch.
With the countdown clock at around three minutes, the launch was hit with a third delay when liquid oxygen valves on two of Orion's three rocket boosters would not close properly. NASA engineers resolved the issues but then discovered a problem with a hydrogen tank valve.
Eventually a launch time of 9:44 a.m. ET, right at the end of the launch window, was set. However, with limited battery power left for the rocket's video monitoring system, NASA management took the decision to scrub the launch.
Expected to last 4 hours and 23 minutes, Thursday’s orbital mission aimed to take Orion deeper into space than any spacecraft built for humans has traveled in more than 40 years.
The unmanned flight, dubbed Exploration Flight Test-1, will provide NASA with vital information on the spacecraft’s performance. NASA plans to eventually use Orion on ambitious manned missions to Mars and an asteroid.
The Orion test flight comes at a crucial time for U.S. spaceflight, which has recently suffered some high-profile setbacks. On Oct. 28 an unmanned Antares rocket exploded in a fireball shortly after liftoff from a NASA launchpad in Wallops Island, Virginia. Just three days later Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo space tourism rocket crashed during a test flight over the Mojave Desert, killing one of the two pilots aboard and seriously injuring the other.
The successor to the now-retired Space Shuttles, Orion was expected to orbit earth twice, covering more than 60,000 miles and reaching an altitude of 3,600 miles, almost 14 times beyond the International Space Station’s orbit.
Thursday’s test was managed by NASA contractor Lockheed Martin. A Delta IV Heavy Rocket built by United Launch Alliance was to carry Orion on the first stage of its journey.
Future Orion launches will use the mega rocket still under development by NASA, known as SLS or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS launch is targeted for 2018, unmanned, followed by the first piloted mission in 2021.
Ahead of the Orion launch, NASA replaced the Kennedy Space Center countdown clock, which dated back to the Apollo 12 mission in 1969, with a new high-tech version. NASA also joined forces with the Sesame Street muppets to count down to Thursday’s test flight.

Whipping around the planet in a relatively low orbit allows for a view of not only a significant chunk of the Earth's surface, but the atmosphere and space above it as well.
The above photo was snapped from the ISS on April 13 and shared via NASA's Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth database. The out of this world (or, at least, above this world) picture shows the bright green aurora australis from a vantage point somewhere over the Indian Ocean.
Look closer at the center of the image and you can see a series of staggered streaks, identified as Starlink satellites owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX.
Satellite tracker Marco Langbroek helpfully annotated the photo to label each of the visible satellites:
Starlink has been a somewhat controversial venture. Its aim is to bring broadband internet service to just about any location on Earth, but that plan involves launching thousands of satellites. With just a few hundred currently in orbit, astronomers say the appliance-size objects are already interfering with scientific observations.
The issue is that the satellites are more reflective than expected (something SpaceX has pledged to correct), which makes them relatively easy to spot from Earth... and apparently from the space station as well.

154,https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/25/crispr-scientist-in-china-claims-his-teams-research-has-resulted-in-the-worlds-first-gene-edited-babies/,"Update: The story is getting even more convoluted. When contacted by TechCrunch’s Rita Liao, a representative at the hospital that supposedly approved Jiankui He’s study stated “what we can say for sure is that the gene editing process did not take place at our hospital. The babies were not born here either.” She also said that the hospital is investigating the validity of the documents connected to the study on ChiCTR.
In what would represent a dramatic and ethically fraught escalation of CRISPR research, a scientist from a university in Shenzhen, China claims he has succeeded in helping create the world’s first genetically edited babies. Jiankui He told the Associated Press that twin girls were born earlier this month after he edited their embryos using CRISPR technology to remove the CCR5 gene, which plays a critical role in enabling many forms of the HIV virus to infect cells.
The AP’s interview with He was published shortly after a report earlier today by the MIT Technology Review that his research team at the Southern University of Science and Technology is using CRISPR technology to edit out the CCR5 gene and create children with resistance to HIV. The Technology Review report cited documents that are up on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry’s (ChiCTR) website (here and here). The ChiCTR is a primary registry of the World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trial Registry.
It is important to note that there is still no independent confirmation of He’s research and that it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. His claims are certain to cause a stir, however, at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, set to begin in Hong Kong on Tuesday. According to the Technology Review, the summit’s organizers were apparently not notified of He’s plans for the study, though the AP says He informed them today.
An American scientist, Michael Deem, also told the AP he worked with He on the project in China.
In his interview with the AP, He, who studied at Rice and Stanford before returning to China, said he felt “a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example” and that “society will decide what to do next.”
According to documents linked by the Technology Review, the study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shenzhen HarMoniCare Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Its summary on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry also said the study’s execution time is between March 7, 2017 to March 7, 2019, and that it sought married couples living in China who met its health and age requirements and are willing to undergo IVF therapy. The research team wrote that their goal is to “obtain healthy children to avoid HIV providing new insights for the future elimination of major genetic diseases in early human embryos.”
A table attached to the trial’s listing on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry said genetic tests have already been carried out on fetuses of 12, 19 and 24 weeks gestational age, though it is unclear if those pregnancies include the one that resulted in the birth of the twin girls, whose parents wish to remain anonymous.
“I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He told the AP, adding that if the study caused harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”
In 2015, Chinese scientists at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou first edited the genes of a human embryo using CRISPR technology (the acronym stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), which enables the removal of specific genes by acting as a very precise pair of “genetic scissors.” Though other scientists, including in the United States, have conducted similar research since then, the Southern University of Science and Technology’s study would be considered especially radical if it indeed has come to fruition. Many scientists and ethicists are concerned about CRISPR technology being abused to perpetuate eugenics or create “designer babies” if used on embryos meant to be carried to term.
As in the United States and many European countries, using a genetically engineered embryo in a pregnancy is already prohibited in China, though the Technology Review points out that this guideline, which was issued to IVF clinics in 2003, may not carry the weight of the law.
In 2015, shortly after the Sun Yat-sen University experiment (which was conducted on embryos that were unviable because of chromosomal effects) became known, a meeting called by several groups, including the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, the Institute of Medicine, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London, called for a moratorium on making inheritable changes to the human genome.
In addition to ethical concerns, Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist and associate director of the Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences, a nonprofit in Seattle, told the Technology Review that He’s study is cause for “regret and concern” because it may also overshadow progress in gene-editing research currently being carried out on adults with HIV.

Chinese officials and scientists have denounced the claims of a geneticist who said he had created the first gene-edited babies.
Authorities have ordered an investigation as a hospital linked to the research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
The National Health Commission said on Monday it was “highly concerned” and had ordered provincial health officials “to immediately investigate and clarify the matter”.
Pandora's box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before it's too late
The government’s medical ethics committee in Shenzhen said it was investigating the case, as was the Guangdong provincial health commission, according to Southern Metropolis Daily, a state media outlet.
More than 100 scientists said in an open letter the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in China.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut-and-paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for diseases. However, there are also concerns about its safety and ethics.
Pandora’s box
In videos posted online, scientist He Jiankui defended what he said he had achieved – embryonic gene editing to help protect twin baby girls born this month from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
“Pandora’s box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before it’s too late,” the scientists said in their letter, a copy of which was posted by the Chinese news website the Paper.
“The biomedical ethics review for this so-called research exists in name only. Conducting direct human experiments can only be described as crazy,” the Chinese-language letter, signed by approximately 120 scientists, says.
Yang Zhengang, a Fudan University professor, told Reuters he signed the letter because gene editing was “very dangerous”.
China’s Genetics Society and the Chinese Society for Stem Cell Research said in a statement that the geneticist had acted as an “individual” and his work posed “tremendous safety risks for the research subjects”.
“We believe the research led by He is strongly against both the Chinese regulations and the consensus reached by the international science community,” the two groups said in a statement posted online.
He, who is due to speak at a summit on human genome editing at the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Shenzhen Harmonicare Hospital, listed on China’s online clinical trial registry as having given ethical approval for He’s experiment, denied having ever taken part in any clinical operations relating to “gene-edited babies”.
‘Very shocked’
The signatures on the online form were suspected of having been forged and “no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”, Hong Kong-listed Harmonicare Medical Holdings said in a statement.
The Southern University of Science and Technology, where He holds an associate professorship, also said it had been unaware of the research project and that He had been on leave without pay since February.
The Shenzhen City Science and Innovation Committee, a municipal fund which was also listed on the clinical trial registry as having backed the trial, said in a statement on Monday it had never been involved in the project.
Xu Nanping, vice minister in China’s science and technology ministry, told reporters he was “very shocked” on hearing He’s claim, adding that such work had been prohibited since 2003.
Details of the case were still unclear, Xu said.
“We don’t know if this work is real or fake. If it’s real, then this is certainly banned in China.”
The official Xinhua news agency said ethics could not be ignored.
“Scientific exploration is never-ending … but this does not mean that the morals of science can be abandoned or that ethical standards can be ignored,” the news agency said in a comment posted on social media.
The committee organizing the Hong Kong conference where He is due to speak – the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing – said in a statement on Monday it had only been informed of He’s work on the genes of the twin girls.

Thanksgiving is a special time for most Americans, but only one citizen will have a truly out-of-this world holiday experience.
NASA astronaut Kevin Ford will celebrate Thanksgiving in space while orbiting about 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth's surface. Ford commands the International Space Station's Expedition 34 mission, and he's the only American aboard the orbiting lab at the moment.
Like most of his countrymen, Ford will get today (Nov. 22) off, as will his two Expedition 34 crewmates, Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin. The trio will mark the holiday in the time-honored American way.
""We'll have a little Thanksgiving feast onboard,"" Ford said in a video beamed down from the space station Tuesday (Nov. 20). He proceeded to show viewers what's on the menu, brandishing packets of smoked turkey, Russian mashed potatoes with onions, dehydrated cornbread dressing and cherry-peach cobbler, among other items.
While Thanksgiving is not a holiday most Russians observe here on the ground, the situation is different in space. Aboard the station, crewmembers tend to celebrate the holidays of their international colleagues.
Astronauts have been celebrating the U.S. holiday on the International Space Station each year for more than a decade. The first Thanksgiving on the station was in 2000, just after the first crew took up residence on the orbiting lab. That crew, Expedition 1, also included a single American on the team: mission commander William Shepherd. [Holidays in Space: Astronaut Photos]
Ford said he, Novitskiy and Tarelkin have a lot to be thankful for this year.
""One of the things I would like to say we're really thankful for — of course, outside of our family and friends — is the support we receive from Earth 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year round, from our international flight control teams,"" Ford said. ""So thank you for that support and being with us.""
Ford, Novitskiy and Tarelkin arrived at the space station on Oct. 25. Upon floating through the airlock, they joined Expedition 33, which was commanded by NASA astronaut Sunita Williams and also included Japanese spaceflyer Akihiko Hoshide and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko.
Williams, Hoshide and Malenchenko returned to Earth on Nov. 19, leaving Ford in command of the new Expedition 34. He, Novitskiy and Tarelkin will be joined by three new crewmembers next month, just in time to celebrate Christmas and to ring in the New Year.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec 4 (Reuters) - The launch of NASA’s deep-space Orion capsule for a test flight around Earth was delayed on Thursday after a last-minute technical problem with its rocket, NASA said.
United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing that builds and flies the Delta 4 rocket, plans to try again at 7:05 a.m. EST (1205 GMT) on Friday.
Gusty winds at the seaside spaceport initially postponed the launch for more than an hour Thursday morning.
The countdown was restarted after the weather cleared, but was halted again when two valves on the rocket apparently failed to close about three minutes before liftoff. With the glitch unresolved before the end of Thursday’s two-and-a-half hour launch window, Orion’s test flight was postponed.
“Despite the valiant attempts of the launch teams and mission managers we basically ran out of time in trying to troubleshoot the last of the issues,” said NASA launch commentator Michael Curie.
For its orbital debut Orion, which is flying without a crew, is expected to soar as far as 3,600 miles (5,800 km) from Earth so that it can slam back into the atmosphere at a speed of about 20,000 mph (32,000 km/h), giving its heat shield a workout of 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 degrees Celsius).
Splashdown in the Pacific Ocean is expected about four-and-a-half hours after launch. Eventually, NASA plans to use Orion capsules to fly astronauts to and from Mars.
NASA already has spent more than $9 billion developing Orion, which will make a second test flight without crew in about four years. A third mission, expected around 2021, will include two astronauts on a flight that will send the capsule into a high orbit around the moon.
Since the end of the Apollo moon program in 1972, the United States and the rest of the space-faring world have flown crews only into orbits that are a few hundred miles from Earth.
“This flight is a big step toward fulfilling a promise we made to the American people when we retired the space shuttle that we are going to take that money and build some incredible vehicles that can do amazing things,” said astronaut Rex Walheim.

158,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-china-gene-editing-research-20181128-story.html,"HONG KONG — He Jiankui, the Chinese researcher who claimed this week to have helped produce the world's first genetically altered babies, said Wednesday there was another ""potential pregnancy"" involved in his study as he defended a procedure that has shaken the scientific world.
Appearing in public for the first time since revealing he had successfully altered the DNA of twin girls while they were embryos to make them resistant to HIV infection, the Stanford-trained bioengineering professor said he felt ""proud"" of his work and its implications for public health in the face of nearly universal condemnation.
""We should, for millions of families with inherited disease, show compassion,"" he told a packed audience at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong. ""If we have this technology, we can make it available earlier. We can help earlier those people in need.""
He's scientific talk chronicled the development of this line of research, from early mouse experiments to primates and eventually a human clinical trial. He said that eight couples were enrolled in the trial, but one dropped out. All had fathers with well-controlled HIV and mothers who were not infected.
There were 31 embryos created through in vitro fertilization, and 70 percent were successfully edited. He showed data indicating that he had not detected unintended genetic changes caused by CRISPR/Cas-9, the gene-editing tool that he used - although it remains to be seen whether outside scientists will find the evidence convincing.
The disclosure this week of He's research - carried out in southern China mostly under a shroud of secrecy - has sparked urgent debate about the ethics of gene-editing and raised the prospect of a future in which parents produce ""designer babies"" with selectively improved traits like intelligence or strength.
Midway during He's talk, Nobel Laureate David Baltimore said the study resulting in the birth of two girls showed ""there has been a failure of self-regulation in the scientific community.""
The ethics of the procedure are also complicated by the fact that targeting specific segments of DNA may not be fully precise or carry side effects that are difficult to predict.
He said Wednesday he was ""against genome-editing for enhancement"" and that he would conduct the experiment on his own unborn daughter if she were at risk with HIV infection. He said he worked with seven couples and 31 embryos, more than 20 of which were edited. Aside from ""Lulu"" and ""Nana,"" two apparently healthy girls that have been born, there is another mother in the study in the ""early stages"" of pregnancy, he said.
He's work came to light this week on the eve of the Hong Kong conference after the Associated Press and MIT Technology Review published extensive on-camera interviews with the researcher, whose lab also posted videos about the breakthrough on YouTube. The revelation was stunning, not only because the genomics field had declared a voluntary international moratorium on editing embryos three years ago, but also because it came before He's work was peer-reviewed or published in a journal.
He opened his appearance on Wednesday by apologizing for news about his work ""leaking"" before it passed peer review. He said the work has been submitted to a journal, but he did not specify which publication.
Asked why he had kept his work secret, He said that he had talked openly about his research at conferences, including at Berkeley, and had consulted with ""several experts"" in the United States at Stanford and in China as he moved into clinical trials. He did not name those people.
Amid repeated questions about the ethics and methodology of his experiment, He said he found volunteers through a social network of HIV carriers and explained, line by line and over 70 minutes, the implications of the study to seek their informed consent. When asked if he had considered the implications of carrying out the procedure on the behalf of two unborn girls with potentially unknown physical or emotional consequences, He said he could not answer the question.
But He, seated and speaking calmly throughout, said he saw profound value in what he had accomplishment, having visited villages in China where a third of the population was ravaged by AIDS and having helped an HIV-infected father produce a daughter.
""I feel proud,"" He said. ""I feel proudest because the father thought he lost hope for life. When the baby was born, he sent a message at the first saying I will work hard for and take care of my two daughters for the second half of his life.""
He said his job was to be ""transparent, open, and share the knowledge I accumulated to society, to the world, and then, let society decide what it should do in the next step.""
Born in China's Hunan Province, He graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2006 and pursued a PhD at Rice and postdoctoral research at Stanford.
In 2012, he was recruited by a Chinese government-backed Thousand Talents Plan, which aims to bring leading international experts in science and technology to the country.
This week, hundreds of Chinese scientists signed two letters condemning He's research as ""crazy"" and calling on the government to explicitly ban the practice of implanting edited embryos from reproduction.
National and local health authorities in China announced investigations on Monday into He's research.
Several institutions affiliated with the researcher also grappled with the fallout as they distanced themselves from He or denied knowledge of his work.
He's Southern University of Science and Technology said this week the work was carried out ""outside of the school"" and seriously violated academic ethics and norms. A copy of the informed consent form used for the study and posted online, however, listed the university as a funder of the experiments.
The Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital where He carried out procedures also denied knowledge of the experiments - and said it would lodge a police complaint against He - despite a hospital executive, Lin Zhitong, appearing on camera in an AP interview hailing the research.
Timothy Henrich, a translational HIV researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, said in an interview before He's talk that about half of HIV strains don't need the gene that was edited to infect patients, meaning the immunity it would confer would not be complete even if the experiment was a complete success.
""I cannot find a scientific rationale to do this, other than the proof of concept that you could modify the embryo and bring it to term,"" Henrich said.
But while many scientists have been quick to condemn He's experiment, some leaders began to give cautionary warnings about foreclosing a promising field of biomedical research.
Harvard Medical School dean and stem cell scientist George Daley gave a presentation at the summit arguing that while He's experiment was a ""misstep,"" gene-editing technology had advanced in the last three years. He warned of the dangers if the scientific community were to ""stick our heads in the sand"" and ignore the potential benefit of the technology to eliminate diseases.
""I think after yesterday, with the revelations of the births of gene-edited twins, I think the tide was largely negative and the prospect of anticipating ethical uses in the future was almost set aside,"" Daley said. ""I think we do that with some risk. Just because the first steps into a new technology are missteps, it doesn't mean we shouldn't step back, restart and think about a plausible and responsible pathway for clinical translation.""",0

The flight will mark the first astronaut launch from US soil since 2011, and it will be the first SpaceX flight carrying passengers, not just cargo.
If successful, this Crew Dragon Demo-2 test will clear the way for a series of regular Crew Dragon flights to the International Space Station. NASA has already lined up astronauts for this test and the first operational flight, which it hopes to launch later this year.
BREAKING: On May 27, @NASA will once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil!

The Demo-2 flight was originally scheduled for May 7th, so it is delayed a bit. But it’s not uncommon for space launches to be pushed back. And given the coronavirus pandemic, a few weeks seems like a minor setback.
The spacecraft will fly on top of a Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It will deliver astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the space station. As you’d hope, it has already completed a number of successful tests, including engine and launch escape tests.",1

Turkey and all the trimmings are a staple for Americans on Thanksgiving, and that doesn't have to change for Americans in space.
Astronaut food has come a long way from the early days of human spaceflight, and crewmembers on the International Space Station these days can enjoy many Turkey Day traditions, such as cornbread stuffing, yams, mashed potatoes, cherry blueberry cobbler, and, of course, turkey itself.
This year, NASA astronaut Kevin Ford, commander of the space station's Expedition 34 mission, will celebrate with his Russian crewmates Evgeny Tarelkin and Oleg Novitskiy.
""Thanksgiving is not a holiday that the Russians celebrate, but we have found that on orbit the crewmembers celebrate each others' holidays,"" said Vickie Kloeris, manager of the Space Food Systems Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""They will take part in Kevin Ford's celebration of Thanksgiving, just as American crewmembers will take part in some of the Russian holidays."" [Thanksgiving Feast in Space - The Menue (Video)]
The space station's Thanksgiving delicacies will come in somewhat different forms than what may be on most holiday tables, though. Space food falls into two categories: freeze-dried (just add water) or thermostabilized (comes in a pouch). And all food sent to the space station has to meet certain microbiological requirements and have a sufficient shelf life.
For example, the cornbread dressing on offer is a replacement for the traditional bread-based stuffing that many people are used to. However, break makes too many crumbs that float around in all directions in weightlessness and are difficult to clean up.
Still, the current Thanksgiving menu is a huge improvement over what earlier space travelers had available.
""If you want to go all the way back to Mercury and Gemini, there were no holiday meals back then,"" Kloeris told SPACE.com. ""All you had was cube foods and tube foods. We've definitely expanded greatly the amount of traditional items that we have made available for holiday times, and that only makes sense because when we started having crewmembers stay on space station long term, we knew every year we'd be hitting Thanksgiving and Christmas with somebody.""
In addition to the standard holiday menu items, each astronaut gets a certain number of ""bonus containers"" to pack whatever particular foods they'd like, provided they meet the basic requirements. Most pack off-the-shelf products like cookies and other treats.
""We have crewmembers who take icing in tubs and cookies, and they’ll ice them at Christmas time,"" Kloeris said. ""We've even had crewmembers take food coloring so they could color the icing.""
The importance of having traditional holiday foods varies from crewmember to crewmember, she said. ""That's always evident when they go to plan their bonus containers. You immediately know who has the strongest ties to holiday food because they’ll be the first ones to bring up the fact that, 'Hey, I'm going to be up there at Christmas.'""
Each of the holiday foods that are provided by NASA have made it through a thorough vetting process.
It starts with a basic recipe for, say, cherry blueberry cobbler. Then the NASA food scientists modify the recipe so that it can be packed in pouches, which is similar to canning. After that, they test its texture, color, and taste.
""When it goes through the thermostabilizing process, the chemistry of the food changes quite a bit,"" Kloeris said. ""Often what happens is we'll take a formulation and we'll try it afterwards, and it's like, 'No, that’s not acceptable.'""
The scientists often have to go through many iterations of a recipe, including scaling it up so it still tastes good if made in large batches, before a food is ready for orbit. And some recipes just never quite make it.
""We tried for a while to come up with thermostabilized cheesecake, and we just flat gave up on it,"" Kloeris said. ""The color changes we got were just too severe. Not everything works.""
But other foods that are stereotypically associated with space are actually rarely eaten there.
""The freeze-dried ice cream actually only flew once"" on an Apollo mission, when a crewmember requested it, Kloeris said. ""It's more like hard cotton candy. Certainly if [astronauts] wanted to request that they could, but that's not something that adults want. Kids like it; they sell it at the gift shop.""

- NASA: The Soyuz spacecraft has returned to Earth from the International Space Station
- One American and two Russians will land just before midnight
- Russian Soyuz space modules have proven very reliable
- It is the standard transportation mode to the ISS after a deadly space shuttle crash
The Soyuz capsule returned Friday night landing in northeast Kazakhstan bringing an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts back from a journey to the International Space Station, NASA said.
The vessel capsule needed less than three and a half hours to descend to Earth.
The return, initially scheduled for Thursday, was postponed because of inclement weather at the landing site northeast of the Russian town of Arkalyk, NASA said.
The American expedition commander, Kevin Ford, and Russian Flight Engineers Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin spent 142 days on the station after launching into space on October 23, 2012.
The crew members spent their unexpected extra day in space reviewing undocking and landing procedures as well as working with the remaining crew members on the handover of duties, NASA said.
Ford passed the helm of the space station to Chris Hadfield of the Canadian Space Agency. Hadfield and his crewmates, U.S. astronaut Tom Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko, will oversee the space station until the arrival of the next crew in two weeks, according to NASA.
The journey up to the station takes longer than the return trip to Earth, NASA said. The Soyuz needs a total of two days to catch up with the ISS in its orbit.
NASA TV planned to broadcast the undocking and landing live.",1
164,https://www.france24.com/en/20181126-china-hiv-scientist-claim-gene-edited-babies-dna,"A video posted on YouTube by university professor He Jiankui said that the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had had their DNA altered to prevent them from contracting HIV, prompting a heated debate among the scientific community.
As experts cast doubt over the claimed breakthrough and others decried it as a modern form of eugenics, China's National Health Commission ordered an ""immediate investigation"" into the case, the official Xinhua news agency reported early Tuesday, citing a statement on the NHC's website.
The professor, who was educated at Stanford University in the US and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said the twins' DNA was modified using CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
The development emerged Sunday in an article published by industry journal the MIT Technology Review, which referenced medical documents posted online by He's research team to recruit couples for the experiments.
He said the babies, known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"" although they are not their real names, were born through regular IVF but using an egg which was specially modified before being inserted into the womb.
""Right after sending her husband's sperm into her egg, an embryologist also sent in CRISPR/Cas9 protein and instructions to perform a gene surgery intended to protect the girls from future HIV infection,"" he said.
Gene editing is a potential fix for heritable diseases but it is extremely controversial because the changes would be passed down to future generations and could eventually affect the entire gene pool.
The MIT Technology Review warned ""the technology is ethically charged"".
The claims come ahead of a conference of world experts in Hong Kong this week, with He expected to speak on Wednesday and Thursday.
But there is as yet no independent verification of his claims, which have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal -- an omission that the scientist's critics have seized on.
'Dangerous, irresponsible'
The research has been robustly criticised by Chinese scientists and institutions. The university where He works said he had been on unpaid leave since February and his research is a ""serious violation of academic ethics and norms"".
""This research work was carried out by Professor He Jiankui outside of the school,"" the Southern University of Science and Technology said in a statement Monday.
And a joint statement from a group of 100 scientists in China criticised the findings and called for better state legislation.
""It is a great blow to the global reputation and development of biomedical research in China,"" said the statement posted on social media platform Weibo.
""It is extremely unfair to the vast majority of Chinese scholars who are diligent in scientific research and innovation.""
Other scientists all around the world were also critical, with some saying a YouTube video was an inadequate way of announcing scientific findings, and others warning that exposing healthy embryos and children to gene editing was irresponsible.
Professor Joyce Harper, professor in genetics and human embryology at London's UCL, said: ""Today's report of genome editing human embryos for resistance to HIV is premature, dangerous and irresponsible.""
History of fraud
The issue of editing human DNA is highly controversial, and only allowed in the US in laboratory research -- although US scientists said last year that they had successfully edited the genetic code of piglets to remove dormant viral infections.
But this is not the first time Chinese researchers have experimented with human embryo technology, and last September scientists at Sun Yat-sen University used an adapted version of gene-editing to correct a disease-causing mutation in human embryos.
There is also a history of fraud within China's academic community -- including a scandal last year that led to the withdrawal of 100 ""compromised"" academic papers.
He Jiankui did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP.
Neither was there any response from queries to the organisers of the Hong Kong conference, and it is not clear whether they were aware of He's work.
In a pre-recorded video on the conference's website, biologist and chair of the international summit David Baltimore said: ""We have never done anything that will change the genes of the human race, and we have never done anything that will have effects that will go on through the generations.""

165,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/health/human-genome-summit-investigation-intl,"(CNN)Organizers of a global genome conference have called for an independent investigation into a Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies, describing his research as ""deeply disturbing.""
In a statement wrapping up the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong, the event's organizing board said He Jiankui's research was ""irresponsible"" and called for an assessment to ""verify this claim and to ascertain whether the claimed DNA modifications have occurred.""
He, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, sent shock waves through the scientific community on Monday when he announced in a video posted online that two ostensibly healthy twin girls had been born this month from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV.
The board, made of up 14 leading geneticists from around the world, warned that even if He's claims are verified, the procedure failed to conform with international norms.
""Its flaws include an inadequate medical indication, a poorly designed study protocol, a failure to meet ethical standards for protecting the welfare of research subjects, and a lack of transparency in the development, review, and conduct of the clinical procedures,"" the statement said.
Presenting his findings for the first time at the summit on Wednesday, He publicly defended his work, saying he felt ""proud"" of his achievement. He also raised the possibility of a third child being born, after announcing that a separate woman was pregnant at an early stage with a modified embryo.
He's research has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls from some attending the event for a globally binding code of conduct.
Clinical use of genetic editing 'irresponsible'
Scientists reiterated an agreement made at the previous conference in 2015, that said it would be irresponsible to use such genetic editing until safety issues had been dealt with.
""While we applaud the rapid advance of somatic gene editing into clinical trials, we continue to believe that proceeding with any clinical use of germline editing remains irresponsible at this time,"" the statement said.
Germline gene-editing refers to genetic changes in every cell, that will be passed on to future generations. This is different to somatic (body) cell gene-editing, whereby only existing cells are targeted and the changes made are not passed on to future offspring.
Conference Chairman and Nobel laureate David Baltimore acknowledged that verifying He's claims would be challenging as no one knows who or where his subjects are.
""We have called for an investigation but we haven't laid out how to do it, because it depends on what kind of cooperation we get from him,"" Baltimore said.
Separately, He is the subject of an investigation by the Chinese government.
In a joint statement issued Monday, more than 120 Chinese scientists condemned He's use of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool as a ""huge blow"" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research.
""It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientists who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics,"" they wrote, adding that ""directly experimenting on humans is nothing but crazy.""
Both the hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, and the university he is affiliated with, have denied any involvement in the procedures.
Organizers on Thursday proposed establishing standards for preclinical evidence and accuracy of gene modification that include ""enforceable standards of professional behavior.""
Currently, each country has their own rules and regulations surrounding gene-editing.
Scientific community 'needs to do more'
Speaking in a question-and-answer session after He's presentation on Wednesday, Baltimore said the case showed that ""there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community because of the lack of transparency.""
That He could tinker with life changing technology away from the eyes of regulators has caught many in the scientific community on the back foot.
""We did not know this was coming,"" Jennifer Doudna, professor of chemistry and molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and one of the co-inventors of CRISPR told CNN.
""I hope this is a wake-up call for everybody to recognize that while this technology is incredibly exciting, this is an important moment where we need to grapple with responsibility of managing this technology going forward.""
Days before the conference Feng Zhang, also a co-inventor CRISPR, and member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, called for a moratorium on using the technology to edit the genes of babies.
""The technology is still very early and there are a lot of challenges that need to be resolved,"" he told CNN. Zhang acknowledged that regulating this type of research would be difficult but said it was important to come up with ""a set of requirements for how to put forward a comprehensive and informative application for experimental medicine development.""
""We can do more on that front,"" he said.",0
166,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/30/gene-editing-chinese-scientist-he-jiankui-jailed-three-years,"A Chinese court has sentenced He Jiankui, the scientist who sparked global controversy last year when he claimed to have created the world’s first “gene-edited” children, to three years in prison for violating medical regulations.
He shocked the scientific community when he announced at a conference in Hong Kong that he had created genetically modified twin sisters, dubbed Lulu and Nana, and that a third child was on the way.
The court in Shenzhen found He guilty of “illegal medical practices” and in addition to the prison sentence fined him 3m yuan (£327,360), according to the state news agency, Xinhua. Two others on He’s research team received lesser fines and sentences.
“The three accused did not have the proper certification to practise medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment,” the court said, according to Xinhua. “They’ve crossed the bottom line of ethics in scientific research and medical ethics.”
He said he used a gene-editing procedure known as Crispr-Cas9 to rewrite the DNA in the girls’ embryos. The scientist claimed the modifications would make the children immune to HIV by turning a gene called CCR5 into a mutant form that prevents the virus from invading cells.
But the court found He had forged documents from an ethics review panel that were used to recruit couples for the research. The couples that enrolled had a man with HIV and a woman without and were offered IVF in return for taking part.
Zhang Renli, who worked with He, was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1m yuan. Colleague Qin Jinzhou received an 18-month sentence, but with a two-year reprieve, and a 500,000 yuan fine.
He’s experiments, which were carried out on seven embryos in late 2018, sent shockwaves through the medical and scientific world. The work was swiftly condemned for deceiving vulnerable patients and using a risky, untested procedure with no medical justification. Earlier this month, MIT Technology Review released excerpts from an early manuscript of He’s work. It casts serious doubts on his claims to have made the children immune to HIV.
The HIV virus gets inside cells by latching on to a protein encoded by the CCR5 gene. But a small percentage of people carry a natural mutation that the virus cannot attach to, making them effectively immune to the disease. He attempted to recreate this mutation by rewriting the DNA in the embryos that couples donated. Fyodor Urnov, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, told MIT Technology Review that He’s claim to have recreated the CCR5 mutation was “a deliberate falsehood”. Instead, the team created new mutations in the target gene and apparently elsewhere in the genome, too, the consequences of which are unknown.
Even as the scientific community turned against He, the scientist defended his work and said he was proud of having created Lulu and Nana. A third child has since been born as a result of the experiments.
Robin Lovell-Badge at the Francis Crick Institute in London said it was “far too premature” for anyone to pursue genome editing on embryos that are intended to lead to pregnancies. “At this stage we do not know if the methods will ever be sufficiently safe and efficient, although the relevant science is progressing rapidly, and new methods can look promising. It is also important to have standards established, including detailed regulatory pathways, and appropriate means of governance.”
These aspects are being looked at by the Academies Commission and by a WHO committee, both of which are due to report in 2020.",0

The launch will take place from Kennedy Space Center's historic pad 39A, which was also used for the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.
STS-135, the last space shuttle mission, launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on July 8, 2011. The space shuttle Atlantis carried four NASA astronauts on the mission to resupply the ISS, as well as an experiment for robotically refueling satellites in space.
Since then, the U.S. has relied on Russian Soyuz rockets launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to get astronauts into space. Russia charges the U.S. about $75 million to send an astronaut into space.
NASA ASTRONAUTS WILL RETURN TO SPACE FROM US SOIL 'BEFORE SUMMER': PENCE
NASA’s announcement comes despite the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the globe.
Earlier this year, Vice President Mike Pence vowed that NASA astronauts will soon launch into space from U.S. soil for the first time in almost 10 years.
Pence, who is chairman of the National Space Council, gave the speech at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia on Feb. 19.

“Before we even get to the summer, with the strong support of all of you, the United States will return American astronauts to space on American rockets from American soil,” he explained. “We’re going back, and we going back from the USA.”
Pence also discussed the plan to put Americans on the moon again. NASA’s Artemis program aims to land American astronauts on the moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable human presence on Earth’s natural satellite.
After Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, only 10 more men, all Americans, have walked on the lunar surface. The last NASA astronaut to set foot on the moon was Apollo 17 Mission Commander Gene Cernan, on Dec. 14, 1972.

Since October, NASA’s Kevin Ford and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin have been aboard the orbiting outpost, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.
Fog and freezing rain at the landing site in Kazakhstan prevented helicopters from setting up for the crew’s return to Earth, NASA TV commentary said during live mission streaming.
A spokesman for the Russian space agency Roskosmos said the landing would be pushed back by one day and is now scheduled for 7:06 a.m. Moscow time (0306 GMT).
The crew’s descent back to Earth aboard a Russia Soyuz spacecraft will take less than four hours.
In preparation for their departure, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield took the helm of the space station on Wednesday, becoming the first Canadian to take command of the outpost.
It is only the second time in the 12-year history of the station, a project of 15 nations that has been permanently staffed since November 2000, that command has been turned over to someone who is not American or Russian.

International Space Station crew members evacuated to the Russian side of the station twice on Wednesday because of worries of a possible ammonia leak, but less than 12 hours after a warning alarm roused them from their sleep, everything was back to normal, NASA said.
Wearing protective masks, two astronauts, Terry Virts of NASA and Samantha Cristoforetti of the European Space Agency, opened the hatch that separates the American and Russian segments at 3:05 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Tests of the air showed no signs of ammonia, which is poisonous if inhaled, so the astronauts returned to the American side.
The problem appeared more likely to have been caused by a faulty computer card than an actual leak.
An alarm had awakened the crew around 4 a.m. Eastern when pressure increased in one of two water loops in the space station’s cooling system. The water loops remove heat from the space station. The heat is transferred to loops of ammonia on the outside of the station and radiated into outer space.
A problem with the heat exchanger could cause ammonia to leak into the water loop and then into the American segment of the space station.
The space station consists of two essentially independent segments, one built by Russia, the other by the United States and other nations.
The astronauts put on gas masks, moved into the Russian segment and closed the hatch.
After sifting through the measurements, the managers at mission control let the astronauts return. But then air pressure in the American segment also started to rise. “If you’re leaking ammonia into the water loop and it eventually finds its way to the cabin, you would expect the cabin pressure to go up,” said Michael T. Suffredini, the manager of the space station, in an interview on NASA Television.
The crew evacuated to the Russian segment a second time.
Nonessential systems were turned off to avoid the possibility of overheating but were later gradually restarted.
“Everything is looking pretty normal right now,” James Kelly, an astronaut at mission control, told Barry Wilmore, the station commander, in an update after 8 a.m. Eastern. “It’s a little more positive than we thought before.”
The space station crew includes three Russians, Elena Serova, Alexander Samokutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov.
Mr. Suffredini said none of the science research on the space station had been compromised. Freezers preserving samples and supplies had been briefly turned off, but those are designed to remain cold for more than eight hours even if power is lost.
“We were well within that, and all the freezers are back up and running now,” Mr. Suffredini said.",1
171,https://www.france24.com/en/20181130-china-aids-group-really-regrets-role-gene-editing,"The head of a Chinese AIDS support group expressed deep regret Friday for helping a scientist recruit participants for a controversial experiment claiming to have created the world's first genetically-edited babies.
The medical trial, which was led by Chinese scientist He Jiankui, purports to have successfully altered the DNA of twin girls, whose father is HIV-positive, to prevent them from contracting the virus.
The founder of the Baihualin (BHL) China League, who calls himself ""Bai Hua"", reportedly introduced 50 families to He's team for clinical trials.
The AIDS support group operates various online chat groups, including some dedicated to married couples affected by the disease -- the perfect source for He's experiment.
""I admit that I really regret this incident, and am also very worried about these families and their children,"" Bai wrote in statement on BHL's blog Friday.
""I really want to say that I was tricked, but I don't want to push away responsibility either,"" Bai added.
He's experiment has prompted widespread condemnation from the scientific community in China and abroad, as well as a harsh backlash from the Chinese government.
On Thursday, the Chinese ministry of science and technology stressed its opposition to the gene-editing baby experiment, and demanded a halt to the ""scientific activities of relevant personnel"".
The Chinese scientist's claims were ""shocking and unacceptable"" and breached ""the bottom line of morality and ethics that the academic community adheres to"", vice minister Xu Nanping told state broadcaster CCTV, warning that it may have broken the law.
China's National Health Commission has ordered an investigation into He's experiment.
- China's AIDS epidemic -
The public outcry over He's experiment has drawn attention to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in China, which has seen a drastic surge in new cases in recent years.
Last week, citing remarks at a national health commission conference, official news agency Xinhua reported that there were an estimated 1.25 million HIV-positive people in China.
According to statistics from UNAIDS, an international organisation dedicated to AIDS advocacy, a total of 36.9 million people around the world were living with HIV in 2017.
In the 1990s, rural parts of China -- particularly the central province of Henan -- endured the country's most debilitating AIDS epidemic.
It stemmed from a tainted government-backed blood donation programme and infected tens of thousands of people, including entire villages.
However, sexual transmission is now the primary way of contracting HIV in China, not blood transfusions. According to a Xinhua report in September, 93.1 percent of new reported cases in the second quarter were through sex.
The same report said the number of people with HIV/AIDS in China surged 14 percent year-on-year as of the end of June, or by about 100,000 people.
China also has a long history of ostracism of HIV/AIDS patients, which further complicates prevention efforts.
HIV-positive individuals have faced discrimination in the Chinese job market for years, and foreigners with the virus were banned from obtaining visas until 2010.
In December 2014, more than 200 people signed a petition to expel an HIV-positive eight-year-old boy from their village, prompting a national debate and highlighting the stigma involved.
""I hope that everyone can view the HIV/AIDS community in a correct way, and not discriminate against those with HIV/AIDS,"" emphasised Bai in his statement Friday.

Media exposure
Days ahead of the launch, the photogenic astronaut has featured prominently in French news reports.
He has recounted how he was a “space fanatic” as a child growing up in the northern French city of Rouen.
In his family home he would play in a cardboard ""space shuttle"" built by his father, and beg his parents to buy magazines that specialised in space exploration. He said he made career choices that almost “unconsciously” led him to become an astronaut.
After getting a degree in spacecraft design and control, he started his career as a satellite and spacecraft engineer. He was later selected by Air France’s flight training programme and became an airline pilot. In May 2009 he was chosen to be an European Space Agency astronaut -- one of only six picked from a list of 8,413 candidates.
‘Space ambassador’
""Thomas is a remarkable guy,"" former ESA chief Jean-Jacques Dordain told AFP in a recent interview, recounting how he helped pick Pesquet when the pool of candidates had been reduced down to just 10 people.
""He boasts both an interesting professional curriculum and important social attributes that allow him to be comfortable with everyone around him. And finally, he is passionate,” Dordain said. “That makes him a great ambassador for Space.""
In addition to English, Spanish and German, Thomas Pesquet has also spent many hours learning Russian. “It’s probably the most difficult thing I’ve done in the last few years, but we are going to have to use it almost on a daily basis in the Russian vehicle,” he told FRANCE 24 in a recent interview at the ESA’s headquarters in Paris.
Looking back on his life’s path towards space exploration, the astronaut has said he was lucky to have had “a very stable childhood” in northern France. “My parents gave me roots, but also wings.""
Despite his busy schedule, Pesquet says he tries to fit in visits to his girlfriend, who works for the United Nations in Rome.

Geneticist He Jiankui says he’s ‘proud’ of his work, as he defends claims of creating world’s first gene-edited babies.
The Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world’s first genetically-edited babies has paused the trial following an international outcry over the highly controversial procedure.
Geneticist He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, defended his work on Wednesday in front of a packed biomedical conference in Hong Kong, saying he had successfully altered the DNA of twin girls born to an HIV-positive father.
If his claims prove to be true, it would be a medical first.
“For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,” He said when challenged by several peers at the Summit on Human Genome Editing at the University of Hong Kong.
A total of eight volunteer couples – HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers – had signed up to the clinical trial, with one dropping out before it was halted.
He said there had been “another potential pregnancy” involving a second couple, but when questioned further agreed it had been a chemical pregnancy – a term referring to a very early miscarriage.
“I must apologise this result was leaked unexpectedly,” he said of the apparent breakthrough.
“The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation,” he added.
The case prompted a heated debate among the scientific community, with many raising concerns over the lack of verified data and the risks of exposing healthy embryos to gene editing.
The procedure is a potential fix for heritable diseases but it is extremely controversial because the changes would be passed down to future generations and could eventually affect the entire gene pool.
The editing of human DNA is banned in some countries, including the United States, and tightly controlled in others.
‘Backward step’
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
China’s National Health Commission ordered an “immediate investigation” into the case on Monday, the official Xinhua news agency reported, while the Shenzhen hospital meant to have approved the research programme denied its involvement.
But He took to the stage on Wednesday to justify his work and was bombarded with questions as he told the audience that the parents were aware of the potential dangers when they signed up.
“The volunteers were informed of the risk posed by the existence of one potential off-target and they decided to implant,” he said.
Conference moderator Robin Lovell-Badge said the summit organisers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.
Lovell-Badge called He’s trial a “backward step” for the science industry, but described the babies’ birth as “momentous” nonetheless.
David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate from the California Institute of Technology and a leader of the conference, said He’s work “would still be considered irresponsible” because it did not meet criteria scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered.
The case shows “there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community”, Baltimore said, adding that the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday that the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in China. “Pandora’s box has been opened,” they said.
This is not the first time Chinese researchers have experimented with human embryo technology.
Last September, scientists at Sun Yat-sen University used an adapted version of gene-editing to correct a disease-causing mutation in human embryos.",0

- Published
China says the scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies last year acted illegally and in pursuit of fame and fortune, state media report.
Investigators say the researcher faces serious punishment after acting on his own and forging ethical review papers.
In November, he told a genome summit in Hong Kong he was ""proud"" of his gene-editing work, a practice which is banned in most countries, including China.
His announcement was met with condemnation from hundreds of Chinese and international scientists, who said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was unethical.
What does China say?
Prof He's claims had not been verified, but investigators confirmed on Monday that his work had resulted in the birth of twin babies, and that another woman was currently pregnant.
Investigators from Guangdong provincial government said the doctor had raised his own funds, deliberately avoiding oversight.
He had also allegedly used technology of an uncertain safety level in order to carry out human embryo gene editing.
Investigators confirmed Prof He had recruited eight couples to participate in his experiment, resulting in two pregnancies.
They said baby twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana were born in November, and are under medical supervision.
Since Prof He's announcement of his experiment, he is said to have been placed under house arrest in Shenzhen.
What has the scientist claimed?
Speaking to the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong, he said the girls had been ""born normal and healthy"" and they would be monitored over the next 18 years.
He said he had funded the experiment himself and confirmed his university, the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, had not been aware of it.
Prof He also explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment.
One couple dropped out, but there was ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo in its early stages.
He said his study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He was also evasive about other details, including the names of ""some experts"" who, he said, had reviewed his work and offered feedback.",0

But details of the experiment, which has not been independently verified, triggered an immediate backlash, with experts denouncing He's work as an ethical ""mess"".
""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation,"" said He. ""For this specific case, I feel proud, actually, I feel proudest.""
The university professor said the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had their DNA altered to prevent them from contracting HIV. Eight volunteer couples -- HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers -- signed up to the trial, with one dropping out before it was paused.
He said there had been ""another potential pregnancy"" involving a second couple, but when questioned further agreed it had been a chemical pregnancy -- a term referring to a very early miscarriage.
The experiment has prompted heated debate among scientists over the risks involved. Editing human embryos can create unintended mutations in other areas -- so-called ""off-target effects"" -- which can have an impact through the lifetime, experts warned.
""The volunteers were informed of the risk posed by the existence of one potential off-target and they decided to implant,"" He said Wednesday, as he was bombarded with questions about the trial.
He also said he had personally paid for most of the patients' medical expenses, and that his university in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen had been ""unaware of the study's conduct.""
Southern University of Science and Technology distanced itself from He, saying he had been on unpaid leave since February and had ""seriously violated academic ethics"".
'Backward step'
Organisers of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing also said they had not known about He's work.
Conference moderator Robin Lovell-Badge said He's trial was a ""backward step"" for the science industry, but described the babies' birth as ""momentous"" nonetheless.
""This is an example of an approach that was not sufficiently careful and cautious and proportionate,"" he said.
""Clearly however... it is a momentous point in history.""
Summit chair David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate, said there had been ""a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community"".
Antonio Regalado, senior editor for biomedicine for MIT Technology Review -- the publication which first highlighted the trial on Sunday -- said He's talk was ""ethically a half-baked mess"".
He, who was educated at Stanford University, said the twins' DNA was modified using CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
But the co-inventor of CRISPR condemned He's trial as dangerous and unnecessary.
""My concern is that this experiment really shouldn't have happened,"" said Feng Zhang told reporters at the conference. ""What he has done was not science.""
'Resolutely oppose'
Gene editing is a potential fix for heritable diseases but it is extremely controversial because the changes would be passed down to future generations and could eventually affect the entire gene pool.
In many countries the editing of human DNA is tightly controlled.
He's experiment would be prohibited under Chinese laws and regulations, according to state media CCTV, citing remarks by deputy minister of China's Ministry of Science and Technology Xu Nanping.
Specifically, Chinese laws limit in vitro human embryonic stem cell research to a maximum of 14 days, said Xu.
But former Chinese health ministry official Qiu Renzong said lax regulations in China mean that scientists who break the rules often face no punishment.
China's National Health Commission ordered an ""immediate investigation"", the official Xinhua news agency reported, while the Shenzhen hospital meant to have approved the research denied its involvement.
A union of Chinese scientists issued a statement saying it ""resolutely opposes so-called scientific researches and biotech applications that violate the spirit of science and ethics,"" Xinhua said.
There is a history of fraud within China's academic community -- including a scandal last year that led to the withdrawal of 100 ""compromised"" papers.
He has not released the identities of the participants of his trial.
""It would be really unfortunate... to have the world looking at the first two genome-edited children because think of the pressure that's going to put them under,"" said Lovell-Badge.
But University of Massachusetts Lowell assistant professor Nicholas Evans tweeted: ""(D)on't get me wrong, privacy is vital here. But I am concerned that no one is ever going to get to independently corroborate the story.""

Leading scientists described the work as ‘monstrous’ and ‘far too premature’
A Chinese scientist claims he has helped create the world’s first genetically edited babies.
In research that would be illegal if carried out in most countries, Professor He Jiankui and his team said they altered the embryos of seven couples undergoing fertility treatment.
One successful pregnancy resulting from this treatment resulted in twin girls born earlier this month that the scientists claimed were naturally resistant to HIV.
Scientists have lined up to criticise the research which, if it turns out to be true, would represent a profound leap of science and ethics.
A US scientist also confirmed that he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in his home country because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and risk harming other genes.
Many mainstream scientists therefore think it is too unsafe to try, and some denounced the experiment as “monstrous” human experimentation.
Professor He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have: an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the Aids virus.
He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.
There is no independent confirmation of the claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it on Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organisers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin on Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with the Associated Press.
“I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” he told AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.
Professor Julian Savulescu, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, said considering the effective ways to prevent HIV in healthy individuals and to treat those suffering from the disease, the work undertaken in China was indefensible.
“If true, this experiment is monstrous,” he said.
“Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.”
Dr Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, agreed that the research was “far too premature” given the current status of gene editing research.
“We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal,” he said.
However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s Professor George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat”.
“I think this is justifiable,” Professor Church said of that goal.
In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body, using a tool that makes it possible to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems.
It’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different – the changes can be inherited.
While this is outlawed in the US and the UK, China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.
Profesor He studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the US before opening a lab at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.
The US scientist who worked with him on this project after Professor He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice. Professor Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in and serves on the scientific advisory boards of Professor He’s two companies.
The Chinese scientist said he chose to try embryo gene editing for HIV because those infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that allows HIV to enter a cell.
All the men in the project had HIV and all the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, Professor He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring.
Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.
He said the gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilisation. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was used.
When the embryos were three to five days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. Eleven embryos were used in six attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, Professor He said.
Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, he said. People with one copy can still get HIV.
Several scientists reviewed materials that Professor He provided to AP and said tests so far are insufficient to draw conclusions.
It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “Aids vaccine development” programme.
The study participants are not ethicists, Professor He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line”.
“I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” he said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility”.
Other researchers said that whatever the ultimate conclusions, Professor He’s experiments should serve as a warning of what is to come.
“It was inevitable that someone trying to reach the limelight would likely try this. However it is often better to be safe than to be first,” said Professor Peter Braude, a reproductive health specialist at King’s College London.
Dr Yalda Jamshidi, a human genetics expert at St George’s, University of London, added: “Whether the results stand up to scrutiny or not we need as a society to think hard and fast about when and where we are willing to take the risks that come with any new therapeutic treatment, particularly ones that could affect future generations.”

He Jiankui shocked the world in 2018 when he announced that twin girls Lulu and Nana had been born with modified DNA to make them resistant to HIV, which he had managed using the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 before birth.
He, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said at the time that he was ""proud"" of the achievement. He later claimed that a second woman was pregnant as a result of his research.
But he was condemned by many of his peers, with the experiment labeled ""monstrous,"" ""unethical,"" and a ""huge blow"" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research. Many people within the scientific community raised ethical concerns, including the level of consent He had obtained from the parents of the babies, and the level of transparency around gene editing.
On Monday, the Shenzhen Nanshan District People's Court sentenced He to three years behind bars and a 3 million yuan ($430,000) fine, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
According to the court's findings, He became aware of potential economic gains from human embryo gene-editing technology in 2016, Xinhua reported. He worked with two medical researchers, Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, to use gene-editing technology to produce babies that were resistant to HIV.
""The court held that the three defendants failed to obtain a doctor's qualification and pursued profit, deliberately violated the relevant national regulations on scientific research and medical management, crossed the bottom line of scientific and medical ethics, and rashly applied gene-editing technology to human-assisted reproductive medicine, and disrupted the medical treatment,"" Xinhua reported. ""The nature of their behavior is serious and has constituted the crime of illegal medical practice.""
Zhang was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1 million yuan ($143,000), while Qin was given a suspended sentence of one year and six months in prison and fined 500,000 yuan ($71,600). According to Xinhua, all three defendants pleaded guilty in trials that were closed to the public to protect individual privacy.
All three defendants have reportedly also been banned from engaging in human-assisted reproductive technology services for life.
Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many countries, including the United States. In the United Kingdom, embryos can only be edited for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.
In January this year, investigators from Guangdong Province Health Commission said that He had conducted the work ""in pursuit of personal fame and fortune, with self-raised funds and deliberate evasion of supervision and private recruitment of related personnel."" The authorities also said He forged ethical review documents and blood tests to circumvent a ban on assisted reproduction for HIV-positive patients.
China has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, with the government bankrolling research into a number of world ""firsts,"" including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.",0

He Jiankui was reportedly convicted of conducting an ""illegal medical practice.""
A court in Shenzhen reportedly found He, along with two colleagues, violated Chinese regulations and ethics by editing twin embryos' DNA. Authorities also found his team fabricated regulatory paperwork, according to state news agency Xinhua. He and his colleagues reportedly pleaded guilty to the charges.
He was condemned by the scientific community for using the gene-editing technology CRISPR to alter the gene CCR5, which HIV utilizes when infecting humans. CRISPR/Cas9 is a technology that can ""cut and paste"" genes, allowing for the removal and replacement of sections of DNA. The goal of his research was to make the twin girls immune to HIV.
Experts soon concluded He's methods were unethical and scientifically flawed. In a paper published earlier this year, two authors found that gene editing embryos isn't necessary for preventing HIV transmission to the fetus, and it doesn't benefit the babies. They also called He's data ""absurd,"" and said the quality of the science is ""very poor and superficial."" They called for ""the authorities conduct a thorough examination of all the original data and disclose the facts to the scientific community and general public.""
He's work was quickly suspended after he gave his presentation on gene-editing the babies at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in November 2018.

The pushback comes amid claims made online by Chinese scientist He Jiankui that twin girls had been born with DNA altered to make them resistant to HIV, a groundbreaking move that is likely to spark significant ethical questions around gene editing and so-called designer babies.
He, a professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, claims that his lab had been editing embryos' genetic codes for seven couples undergoing in-vitro fertilization.
In a video posted to YouTube on Monday, the Chinese researcher said that one of the pregnancies had been successful and that ostensibly healthy twin girls Lulu and Nana had been born ""a few weeks ago.""
He claims that he used a tool known as CRISPR-cas9, which can insert or deactivate certain genes. In his YouTube video, He describes the procedure as having ""removed the doorway through which HIV enters.""
He's claims have neither been independently verified nor peer-reviewed. Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many counties, including the United States. In the UK, editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.

More recently researchers in China claimed to have bred healthy mice from same-sex parents, using gene editing technology.
But in a statement posted Tuesday morning, China's National Health Commission said that it had ""immediately requested the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission to seriously investigate and verify"" the claims made by He Jiankui.
The statement follows moves by the Chinese hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, to distance itself from involvement in the procedures.
""We can ensure that the research wasn't conducted in our hospital nor were the babies born here,"" a hospital representative told CNN. The hospital confirmed that two of the doctors named in He's documents work at the hospital and suggested that an internal investigation was underway.
An initial investigation by the hospital said that signatures on He's ethics review form are suspected to be forged. The hospital has never convened an ethics committee meeting on it, according to a statement on its WeChat account, and the facility will ask police to intervene and investigate it and hold related people accountable by law.
The Shenzhen Health and Family Planning Commission denounced the legitimacy of the hospital ethics committee and the review process that approved the application. It confirmed that an investigation was launched Monday to ""verify the authenticity of the ethical review of the research reported by media.""
He's University, Southern University of Science and Technology, said in a statement that the researcher has been on leave since February 1.
""The research work was carried out outside the school by Associate Professor He Jiankui. He did not report to the school or the department of biology. The university and the biology department are not aware of it,"" the institution said, adding that ""the Academic Committee of the Department of Biology believes that it seriously violates academic ethics and academic norms.""
A 'huge blow' to Chinese research
A joint statement issued by more than 120 Chinese scientists on the Chinese social media site Weibo condemns the human genome-editing research.
""The medical ethics review exists in the name only. Directly experimenting on human is nothing but crazy ... as soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring, as the modified inheritable substance will inevitably blend into human genome pool,"" they wrote, adding that the trial is a ""huge blow"" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research. ""It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientist who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics.""
Julian Savulescu, director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, described the alleged births as ""genetic Russian Roulette.""
""If true, this experiment is monstrous,"" he said. ""The embryos were healthy. No known diseases. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.
""There are many effective ways to prevent HIV in healthy individuals: For example, protected sex. And there are effective treatments if one does contract it,"" Savulescu said.

16.28 Perfect conditions at ocean level for the landing, with low winds reported. Orion is now passing down through the clouds.
16.26 Amazing footage as Orion sheds its initial parachutes and releases the three main parachutes, slowing further and approaching the Earth's surface.
""There is your new spaceship America"", says Nasa.
It is now at 4,000 feet.
16.24 Orion is descending. It has slowed to sub-sonic speed - i.e. below the speed of sound - and is preparing to jettison its forward cover, allowing the release of parachutes (see 15.52). It is now at 35,000 feet.
16.18 Time to splashdown is in seven minutes, with thrusters now being fired to maintain control of Orion as it reenters the Earth's atmosphere. It is currently at 120,000 feet and is experiencing 3Gs of force, which is expected to rise to 8.3G during reentry.
15.52 Orion's landing in the Pacific is due in just over half an hour.
So how does it work? As the below video explains, the landing component of the spaceship - in which astronauts would be located - will use 11 parachutes at different stages of descent to slow down sufficiently for a safe landing.
15.24 Orion is Nasa’s first new vehicle for space travel since the Space Shuttle programme was terminated in 2011. Nasa is hoping to put astronauts back on the Moon by 2020. After that, it is hoped that Orion will journey to Mars in the 2030s.
Astronaut Rex Walheim, who was aboard the final shuttle flight in 2011, said the Orion programme could one day ensure humans become “a multi-planetary species.”
“You have that excitement back here at the Kennedy Space Center and it’s tinged with even more excitement with what’s coming down the road,” he said.
15.01 Final preparations are being made for the retrieval of Orion from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California, where it is due to land in around an hour and a half:
14.28 The ""second stage burn"" which pushed Orion to peak altitude has been executed to plan:
13.57 Orion is minutes away from reaching its peak altitude:
It is currently approaching the west coast of Florida, ready to begin its second - and final - orbit of Earth.
13.35 As Orion continues its first lap of the Earth, Nasa has this update:
13.14 Houston monitors Orion's flight - and we have no problems to report as yet:
Here's another, video look at liftoff:
12.55 Nasa's Orion project is one day intended to take humans to Mars - but the US is not the only country racing to reach the Red Planet first:
12.52 Orion will reach a peak altitude of 3,600 miles - around 15 times higher than the orbit of the International Space Station. That will mark the highest altitude any spaceship capable of transporting humans has reached since Apollo 17.
12.47 Orion is now east of Madagascar, on its first of two orbits of the earth. Nasa is describing Orion's path as a ""picture perfect orbit"".
The spaceship will splashdown into the Pacific Ocean near California at 4.29pm GMT.

12.30 Here's AP's report from Cape Canaveral on today's successful liftoff:
Everything went NASA's way Friday, and the Delta IV rocket blasted off with Orion as dawn broke.
NASA was aiming for a peak altitude of 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers)on Orion's second lap around the planet, in order to give the capsule the necessary momentum for a scorchingly high-speed re-entry over the Pacific. Engineers want to see how the heat shield - the largest of its kind ever built - holds up when Orion comes back through the atmosphere traveling 20,000 mph (32,200 kph)and enduring 4,000 degrees (2,200 Celsius).
The atmosphere at Kennedy Space Center was reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. After more than three years since the last shuttle flight, NASA reveled in all the attention.
12.25 Orion is now in preliminary orbit, and has cut off its second engine.
12.21 Orion is approaching the west coast of Africa, and is now travelling at more than 16,000 miles per hour.
12.20 All quiet in Nasa command centre as scientists ""enjoy the view"" from Nasa's onboard cameras, according to the Nasa commentary (I imagine they are doing slightly more than that):
Everything continuing to go ""extremely well"".
12.16 Orion is now travelling at 15,000 miles per hour. It is currently 155 statute miles above earth, flying over the south Atlantic.
12.15 Here's another look at those remarkable launch images:
12.14 Just a quick reminder of the planned journey Orion will now take, which is due to take 4 hours and 24 minutes:
12.11 Orion is scheduled to enter orbit at 12.22. It is currently jettisoning other launch apparatus including the launch abort system. Its ascent is now being driven its secondary stage rocket engine.
Everything going extremely well. The first two critical milestones have been reached
12.08 Three minutes in and Orion has now separated from its two rocket boosters, as planned.
12.06 Amazing scenes as huge flames billow out from beneath the rocket, and it ascends smoothly up toward space. All going to plan so far.
12.05 Liftoff!
The dawn of Orion and a new era of American space exploration
12.04 Here we go...
12.03 Final preparations and checks for launch are in progress. Second liquid hydrogen tank being attached.
""Everything is go"", says Nasa.
12.01 The four-minute countdown has commenced.
12.00 Here comes the final poll... and we have PERMISSION TO LAUNCH
11.57 Eight minutes to go, and we are still waiting on that final launch poll. Winds remain below limits and no technical issues are being reported.
11.54 We are currently waiting for the final poll to agree on launch. We are ""L minus 12 minutes"", as Nasa says.
Weather remains ""green"", as a spectacular sunrise greets the rocket.
11.52 We are about to find out whether the team has decided to proceed with the launch:
The decision is taken through a nationwide poll:
11.36 Some good news. The weather may be clearing up - and no other issues currently being reported - according to local journalist Mara Bellaby:
11.23 With just over half an hour to go until scheduled launch, AFP has reported on the latest from Cape Canaveral:
Rain and clouds were in the forecast; the wind, while stiffer, was expected to blow in a more favorable direction. Forecasters put the odds of acceptable conditions at 50-50...
Roads leading into the Kennedy Space Center were less congested for this second time around. Nonetheless, the hotels remained packed, the press site was jammed and NASA still anticipated a full house reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. Many of the estimated 27,000 guests were expected to return.

10.57 If the launch is not possible today, there will be another attempt tomorrow:
Meanwhile, an update on this morning's preparations from Nasa's blog:
The launch team completed fueling the three core boosters of the Delta IV Heavy and pumps are now in trickle mode meaning they will top off the tanks as the countdown moves ahead and a small amount of the cryogenic propellants boil off.
10.32 Nasa scientists and space enthusiasts everywhere will be crossing their fingers for a successful launch today for Orion. Liftoff is scheduled for 12.05 GMT, but as noted below, current weather conditions mean there is only a 40 per cent chance of launch.
If launch is delayed, Nasa has a 2-hour, 39-minute window this morning in which the test can take place. If no launch is possible within that timeframe, it will be delayed to another day.
09.53 Early weather forecasts for today's launch are not looking particularly promising, Nasa tweets:
09.25 Confirmation from Nasa that today's launch attempt is a GO:
And in case you were wondering what the rocket has been up to overnight:
09.00 Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the launch of Nasa's new Orion spaceship - take two.
After yesterday's various delays - caused by a boat straying into the launch radius, windy conditions and technical glitches, among other things - Nasa are ready to give it another go today, with launch scheduled for 12.05GMT.
We'll have all the updates here, and you will be able to watch the launch live using the video player at the top of this page.
For more details on the mission, and yesterday's problems, read our coverage of Thursday's proceedings below.
Thursday 4 December
14.42 Right that's enough from me. I guess, all things going to plan, Orion will be heading off into the ether at the same time tomorrow. The planned launch date has now been moved to 12.05 GMT Friday. You can join us here again for live coverage.
14.41
14.40 So a quick recap of today's aborted launch. Things started off well, before an errant boat caused a slight delay. Then some strong gusts kept us hanging for a while, and to top it off, a faulty valve issue finally meant the launch was scrapped for today altogether. We'll have to wait another day before knowing of any life on Mars.
14.35 SCRUBBED. Which is the technical term for no action today folks. But, in better news, sounds like they'll be trying it all over again in 24 hours.
14.32 So, could it be fifth time lucky? We'll find out in all of 12 mins. We still don't know if they've fixed the valve problem. This is getting quite exciting now. (Have now finished my pasta for those wondering)
14.29 Any launch time, should it happen will be right on the dot at 14.44, which is the last possible time we can get this thing going. Looks like there will be a final go at it as the automatic wind monitors have now been turned off.
14.26 This could be our last shot of the day, as crews make their final attempt to sort out the valve issues that have hampered today's launch. They have just under 20 minutes to get it fixed.
14.18 Half an hour remains in today's launch window and it's gone ominously silent over at the Cape...
14.14 Anyone still waiting to grab some lunch, I think it's safe to head out. I've just got hold of a pasta bake from the Telegraph canteen. Lovely.
14.12 The probe set up to film Orion on its descent back to earth is all up and running. Nasa seemed to have got bored with static views of the spaceship and have switched their stream over for a while. What exactly it will be filming, if anything, we're still not sure.
14.10 The dreaded 'w' word is being bandied around again. Yes, wind. Heavy gusts have been causing problems all day. They may now finally put the kybosh on today's launch.
14.07 The Orion team is carrying out some 'trouble-shooting' as we speak. Time is against them to fix this dodgy valve problem. The test should take a few minutes, and then we should have word on whether any launch is possible today.
14.05 40 mins left until the launch window closes, and it's not looking too clever.
13.40 Elmo, like the rest of us has just over an hour to wait, to see if this launch will be happening.
13.37 I think this means they're fixing it...?
13.35 The official explanation for the cause of our delay:
""A fill and drain valve on the rocket did not function correctly. Standing by as rocket and spacecraft are safed.""
13.34 A reminder that, after this fourth delay, the window for launch remains over an hour long. It remains a very distinct possibility that we'll be getting no Orion action today.
13.27 Another 'anomaly team discussion' is underway says our radio man after a fuel drain and valve failed to close.
13.25 Another hold. This time for some fuel issues nearing launch. No new estimated launch time as yet. Knew this was too good to be true.
13.21 As we're due to get underway very shortly (4 minutes), here's a graphical summary of today's maiden launch.
13.19 Orion is back running on its own power. Lets hope its third time lucky. Launch minus 7 minutes.
13.17 And we are back. New launch time is now estimated as 13.26 with any luck.
13.10 Here's what today's maiden test flight is due to look like
13.08 The view from the Cape right now. Conditions are looking quite overcast.
13.05 Still more than 90 minutes to go in today's launch window. We're being delayed by the weather for now. The Orion has a 21 knot limit -- gusts have twice exceeded that limit during the terminal count, but hopefully, should subside.
12.59 Orion's back running on an external power source says the launch commander.
12.54 Ok scratch that. Another hold! More above limit wind again.
12.51 Ok we are back. T-minus four minutes to launch
12.40 Still no word on when the action might be kicking off. In the meantime, Orion of another sort to tide you over.
12.33 Orion is back on external power source as we are held up by ground winds. The original launch time was 12.05. A boat held us up for an initial 10 mins or so but there's still no new estimated launch time.
12.25 A reminder that the Nasa has a launch window of around two and a half hours for Orion's maiden voyage. We've got about two hours and 16 minutes of that remaining.
12.15 Looks like some ""ground winds"" are now adding a slight delay to the launch time, due to be at 12.17. Shouldn't be a 'show-stopper' however say Nasa.
12.12 The launch director has given us the all-clear. Orion will be off in 5 minutes
12.09 Orion is now operating on its own power. We are gearing up to lift off very soon. Seven minutes to go
12.07
12.06 Launch will now be at 12.17. T-minus 11 minutes...
12.05 Orion should have been launching around now, but there's been a delay in proceedings. We still don't know how long the wait will be as the crew try and get a boat out of the way, among other things.
11.56 The launch will now be delayed from the original time of 12.05 says the Delta 4 launch director.
11.51 Latest from Nasa suggests there will be a delay as they try and remove a boat from the launch area.
11.47 Looks like there are some problems with the Nasa stream, but hopefully it should be up and running soon. Orion is fuelled and in place. Lift off will be in around t-minus 18 minutes.
11.30
11.00 Around an hour to go before lift off. Orion's is protected by tiles on its backshell & an ablative heatshield for re-entry into earth.
Here's a primer on how it's all due to work.
10.45 Some diehards are heading out to the viewing centre at the Kennedy Centre to watch today's launch in Florida.
10.25 One of the biggest challenges for the aircraft will be how it handles its re-entry to earth.
Orion's heat shield — the largest of its kind ever built — will have to survive searing temperatures of nearly 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,800 degrees C). The capsule's massive parachutes must the deploy for it to have a successful landing in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles (970 km) southwest of San Diego, California. This should be happening around 1630 our time.
10.20
10.15 Just under two hours to go until the planned launch time. Here's the view from Nasa's press centre where the world's media are gathering to watch events.
10.00 If you're wondering what today's unmanned mission will look like, here's video explainer on just how capsule will work.
09.45 Here's how things are looking at Orion HQ right now, in Cape Canaveral
09.30 Here's a breakdown of today's mission and some key facts:
• The Orion craft will circle the Earth twice before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph.
• It is the first mission since the Apollo moon landings to take a spacecraft built for manned flight into deep space beyond the limit of orbiting satellites.
• During the 4.5-hour flight Orion will travel 3,609 miles from Earth, 15 times the distance to the International Space Station.
• Nasa hopes to use Orion to put astronauts back on the moon by 2020 and take them to Mars in the 2030s. A midway mission to an asteroid is also on the cards.
• Orion will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the end of a Delta IV Heavy, the largest US rocket currently in service.
09.00 Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the launch of Nasa’s new spacecraft Orion.
The craft will make its first unmanned test-flight at around noon GMT from Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral, Florida.",1
183,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/08/10/space-station-astronauts-make-history-eat-first-space-grown-veggies.html,"Space Station astronauts make history, eat first space-grown veggies
Astronauts on the International Space Station made history Monday when they munched space-grown vegetables for the first time.
Crew members, including American one-year astronaut Scott Kelly, sampled the delights of Red Romaine lettuce grown in the microgravity environment of space. The lettuce was grown on the ‘Veggie’ plant system in NASA’s orbiting lab on the space station.
“Crew tastes red romaine lettuce with oil & vinegar for #NASAVeggie study and #JourneyToMars,” tweeted the International Space Station’s Twitter account.
“Chomp! Our first veggies were harvested & consumed by astronauts in space!,” added NASA, tweeting an image of Kelly enjoying his historic meal.
The leafy greens were cleaned with citric acid-based, food safe sanitizing wipes, according to NASA.
The agency’s plant experiment, dubbed Veg-01, uses rooting “pillows,” which contain the seeds.
NASA sees the development of sustainable food in space as a critical part of its Journey to Mars project, which aims to send humans to the Red Planet in the 2030s. However, the long journey to Mars, estimated to take six months, poses a unique set of challenges to scientists.

“As NASA moves toward long-duration exploration missions farther into the solar system, Veggie will be a resource for crew food growth and consumption,” explained NASA, in a statement. “It also could be used by astronauts for recreational gardening activities during deep space missions.”
The first “pillows” were activated, watered and cared for by astronaut Steve Swanson in May 2014, according to NASA. After 33 days of growth, the plants were harvested and returned to Earth in October 2014, undergoing food safety analysis at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center.
The second set of Veg-01 plant “pillows” were activated by Scott Kelly on July 8 and grew again for 33 days before being harvested. The seeds had been on the space state for 15 months before being activated, NASA said.",1
184,https://www.france24.com/en/20181201-what-are-ethics-baby-gene-editing,"A Chinese scientist's stunning claim he has pioneered the world's first genetically modified baby has suddenly made the eternal debate over ethics and emerging scientific capabilities pressing and real.
Should everything that becomes technically possible be carried out? For most ethicists the answer is no -- but the tricky part is whether it can be prevented.
""It's obvious that everything that is technically feasible is not ethically desirable,"" said Cynthia Fleury, a member of the French Ethics Committee.
""But to resist that, in a context of deregulated scientific competition, is structurally destined for failure.""
It's a question as old as science: Are ethics condemned to constantly nip at the heels of advances that burst forth and take a head start?
Certainly the case in China has brought the debate to the fore.
That country's National Health Commission has ordered a probe into the baby gene-editing announced by scientist He Jiankui, in which he claimed to have tinkered with the DNA of twin girls born a few weeks ago to prevent them contracting HIV. China's government said it was opposed to the experiment, while the scientific world erupted in uproar.
The alleged breakthrough has not been verified. And, after a backlash, He said his trial has been suspended and he has disappeared from public view.
""Good science is not just about generating knowledge in a vacuum. Context and consequences are vitally important, and the consequences of this irresponsible action may be dire indeed,"" said Dr Sarah Chan, of the University of Edinburgh.
For all the condemnation, however, it is important to note that many objections were not over the principle of human genetic modification as such, but rather over the way the experiment was carried out.
For instance: it was conducted outside of typical institutional structures, by a lone scientist acting in a way seen by many as premature given the technology used.
He said he employed CRISPR, a technique which allows scientists to remove and replace a strand with pinpoint precision.
But the consequences of the technique are not yet fully known -- particularly whether genetic slicing and splicing like that carried over from one generation to the next, with unpredictable effects. The fear is that reckless application of CRISPR might create ""monsters"".
Another ethical violation raised is that the aim of He's experiment was to protect the babies against AIDS and not to try to cure them of a life-threatening disease.
- ""Trying to rush the technology"" -
The concern of the scientific community is that by stepping across established ethical red lines, ensuing public suspicion could crush a field of very promising research.
While CRISPR might spark unease of a future for humanity straight out of an Aldous Huxley novel, it also bears enormous hopes of being able to treat genetic infirmities.
""Trying to rush the technology forwards, skipping vital scientific and ethical steps, could end up setting us all back,"" warned Dr Kathy Niakan, a biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London.
Yet that view in itself shows just how far ethics have evolved to the pace of scientific change.
For many decades, the idea of modifying human genomes was simply unthinkable. Now, several international scientific organisations conceive of it being possible, within a rigorous framework.
""You can't just say that something is taboo and that's that, you can't ever think about it again,"" Anne Cambon-Thomsen, a specialist in immunogenetics and health ethics, and emeritus head of research at France's CNRS national scientific research centre, told AFP.
""An essential point of our humanity is to be able to react by thinking about what is made possible by our technical abilities,"" said Cambon-Thomsen, who is part of a European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies that advises the EU.
Such a shift in acceptance has already been seen, for example, in the field of organ transplants.
Yet human cloning, at present, still remains an intolerable premise. According to Cambon-Thomsen, that's because ""we have difficulty in showing some sort of (medical) advantage in cloning"".
Following the storm sparked by He Jiankui's announcement, scientists are calling for an international treaty on gene-editing.
But agreeing global regulation ""isn't easy because cultures are different -- we don't think of human beings in the same way in China as in the West,"" observed Thierry Magnin, rector at the Catholic University of Lyon.
Magnin, a theologist and physicist, said: ""Ethics must be integrated right from the start when technologies are developed, and not come in the end.""

185,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183334/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-starlink-launch-5th-time,"Update March 18th, 10:35AM ET: SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket successfully took off on time and deployed all 60 satellites into their intended orbit. However, the rocket failed to land as intended on the company’s drone ship in the Atlantic, so there won’t be a sixth launch of this vehicle. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also confirmed that one of the Falcon 9’s engines shut down early on the climb to space and that the company will be doing a thorough investigation into what happened before the next flight. SpaceX was able to catch both halves of the rocket’s nosecone following the launch — the first time two pieces were caught on a single mission.
Original Story: As the rest of the world slowly grinds to a halt amid the coronavirus pandemic, the US launch industry is still sending rockets into space, with another SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket set to take off from Florida on Wednesday morning. SpaceX is launching its latest batch of 60 satellites for its Starlink constellation, aimed at beaming internet coverage down to Earth. And the company is using a very special Falcon 9 rocket for the job: a vehicle that’s been to space and back four times before.
SpaceX originally tried to launch this mission on Sunday, but it was forced to postpone. The countdown got all the way to T-0, but the rocket aborted just before fulling igniting its engines and taking off. If the vehicle launches successfully today, the rocket will become the first of SpaceX’s fleet to go to space for a fifth time. And it’s possible it could become the first to land for a fifth time, too. SpaceX is aiming to land the Falcon 9 rocket on one of its drone ships in the Atlantic Ocean following the launch, which would be the 51st landing of a Falcon 9 core for the company.
In fact, SpaceX is trying to recover as much of this rocket as possible post-takeoff. Two of SpaceX’s boats equipped with giant nets will attempt to catch the rocket’s nose cone — the bulbous structure on top of the Falcon 9 that shields the satellites during the climb to space. The nose cone, or payload fairing, breaks in two once the rocket is in space and each half falls to Earth, usually hitting the ocean and going unrecovered. But SpaceX has been trying periodically to catch these pieces following launches in order to use them again on future flights.
All in all, it’s an ambitious launch for SpaceX that could contain a lot of firsts for the company. If each piece of hardware lands or is caught as planned, it would be the first time SpaceX has successfully recovered that many pieces of a rocket following a launch. So far, SpaceX has been able to land its Falcon 9 and catch one half of the fairing following a flight; it hasn’t been able to catch both halves on one mission yet.
The enterprising mission comes amid a time of uncertainty for the launch industry, which is just starting to feel the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. While US launches still remain on track, European launch provider Arianespace announced yesterday that it’s suspending all launches from its spaceport in French Guiana for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the company’s personnel and people who live in the area.
So far, SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance — two of the biggest rocket companies in the US — have not announced any delays to launches due to coronavirus concerns. And the US Space Force’s 45th Space Wing, which oversees launches out of Cape Canaveral, Florida, does not anticipate the need to reschedule any missions out of the spaceport at this time.
“The DoD’s priorities are the protection of service members, their families, and the department’s civilian work force; safeguarding and maintaining our ability to defend the nation and its interests; and supporting our U.S. Government partners in this fight,” a US Space Force spokesperson tells The Verge in a statement. “At this time, there are no impacts to U.S. Space Force mission-essential activities due to COVID-19 concerns.” The spokesperson clarified that rocket launches are considered “mission-essential.”
But these launches may have less of an audience than past missions. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, a popular place to view launches out of Cape Canaveral, is temporarily closed to the public. Journalists and photographers covering the launch are normally bused to the launchpad to set up their cameras, but they are now caravanning to the site in their own cars. Other countries are getting even stricter, with Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, completely banning media from attending the April flight of its Soyuz rocket, which will send three crew members to the International Space Station.
It’s an uncertain time for the launch industry right now, with new restrictions changing every few hours. But for now, SpaceX is flying. The company is aiming to launch its Falcon 9 at 8:16AM ET on March 18th. If the rocket doesn’t get off the ground on Wednesday, SpaceX has a backup launch date at 7:56AM ET on Thursday, March 19th. SpaceX plans to live stream the launch, with coverage beginning about 15 minutes before liftoff, so you can watch this mission and continue to social distance at the same time.

186,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/he-jiankui-baby-gene-editing-crispr-dna-aids-prison-sentence-a9263966.html,"China has jailed a researcher who made headlines around the world after announcing his involvement in the births of the first genetically-edited babies.
He Jiankui told an international gene editing conference in November last year he had led a project that resulted in the births of twin babies with an added resistance to the Aids infection.
While Dr He did not provide any corroborating evidence or submit his research for peer review, after an investigation Chinese authorities confirmed the work had been carried out and that the researchers had “deliberately evaded oversight”.
Dr He was convicted on Monday of practising medicine illegally and violating Chinese scientific research regulations, as well as forging ethical review documents. He was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 3 million yuan (£330,000).
The sentencing, reported by the state-run Xinhua news agency, confirmed for the first time that a third baby – from a different mother to the twins – was born as part of the project before it was shut down by the authorities.

Two other people, researchers working under Dr He, were convicted and received lesser sentences. Zhang Renli was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1 million yuan. Qin Jinzhou received an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years, and a 500,000 yuan fine.
Dr He had been held under armed guard at a university guesthouse since he declared his work to the world, including in major interviews with western media.
The court said he and his team “crossed the bottom line of ethics” and “in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment”.
Dr He used gene-editing technology called Crispr to alter the genomes of embryos during the IVF process. Crispr is a low-cost, easy-to-use technique whereby an enzyme is targeted to cut out an unwanted section of DNA.
Since the method of teaching the enzyme which DNA to target was first described in 2012 and 2013, the technique has already led to major breakthroughs in crop development and fixing genetic diseases in animals.
But ethicists say using it to alter the DNA of human embryos is inherently problematic. Not only will the desired genetic change be passed on to all the subject’s future offspring, but it is also impossible to know for sure what untended consequences the editing process might have.
Human clinical trials have been carried out with Crispr – but as therapies for treating blood disorders like sickle cell anaemia, not to alter a person’s entire genetic make-up.

187,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/nasa-astronaut-telomeres-space-ageing-twin-study-kelly-a8865911.html,"Astronaut Scott Kelly lands on earth after 340 days in space
Space is doing some strange things to astronauts' bodies, a new study has found.
The Nasa twins study is looking at two twins – Scott and Mark Kelly – in an attempt to understand the affects of spaceflight on people's health and physiology. By having one remain on Earth while another lived on the International Space Station for more than a year, researchers are able to compare the two in an attempt to understand what difference to the trip into space made.
Now early results show a host of unusual changes happened to Scott when he headed into space. That included the discovery that in some ways, a person's health is not greatly affected at all by a trip into space.
Perhaps most unusually, researchers looked at how astronauts aged when they were on board the International Space Station. They did so in part by looking at the pair's telomeres, or the protective caps that sit on the end of chromosomes and reflect the ageing process in the body, since they typically shorten as a person ages.
In fact, though Scott's telomeres lengthened out when he was in space, a discovery that shocked the researchers.

""We were surprised, that was the first reaction,"" said Colorado State University professor Susan Bailey. ""But that's what science is all about, right?""
But they then also found that they dramatically lengthened again when getting back down. While most of them settled back down again over time and have gone back to normal, he now has more short telomeres than when he set off, suggesting that spaceflight could be associated with age-related conditions.
Otherwise, the study found that the effects of the year-long flight were largely similar to time spent in any other stressful environment. There were changes in Scott's gene expression levels and his gut flora, for instance, but after six months back on Earth they had settled back to normal.
""Given that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight,"" the authors wrote.
Studying the identical twins, who were 50 years old at the start of the study, gave scientists a unique opportunity to compare individuals with the same genetic material subjected to different environments.
Exposure to radiation, lower gravity, less exercise, a restricted diet and disrupted sleep are among the possible risks of spending time in space.
Mark is a fellow astronaut and has also been to space before, but not for almost four years prior to Scott's mission.
""The twins study is certainly the most comprehensive view that we've ever had of the response of the human body to space flight,"" Professor Susan Bailey, from Colorado State University, said.
Blood samples, physiological data and cognitive measurements were taken from the brothers at regular intervals over 25 months.
While Scott was in space, his samples were sent back to Earth with shipments that had delivered supplies by rocket to the ISS.
Changes to the shape of Scott's eyeball, including a thicker retinal nerve, were among those detected, as well as a decline in some of his cognitive abilities.
The scientists also found that the astronaut's telomeres - the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes - got longer while he was in space.
Telomeres typically shorten as someone becomes older and are associated with cardiovascular diseases and some cancers.
However, many rapidly decreased in length after the flight, and he now has more short telomeres than long ones.
There were also changes in the expression of some of Scott's genes, particularly those related to the immune system.

However, more than 90 per cent of these had returned to normal six months after the flight.
Persistent changes were observed in a few other areas, including some cognitive function.
""There are dramatic changes, there are thousands of genes and molecular changes, that occur as someone goes in space,"" Dr Mike Snyder, from Stanford University School of Medicine, said.
""I think it's reassuring to know that when you come back things will largely be back to the same.""
Scientists believe the findings could help predict possible health complications during long-term missions.
""If we know what to expect, we can anticipate health problems astronauts may encounter and ensure that medicines and other remedies are at hand during a mission,"" Dr Andy Feinberg, at Johns Hopkins University, said.

Between March 2017 and November 2018, Dr He carried out the experiments on the volunteer couples of HIV positive males and HIV negative females seeking fertility treatment.
Researchers edited the genes of the human embryos with the aim of making them naturally resistant to HIV and implanting them in the women.
Two volunteers fell pregnant as a result of the experiment. The first gave birth to twin girls known only as Lulu and Nana and the second is still pregnant. One couple dropped out of the project halfway through and the remaining five did not conceive.
Dr He is now facing “punishment according to laws and regulations” and a possible police investigation, Xinhua reported.
Investigators from the Health Commission of China in southern Guangdong province said that the doctor’s activities seriously violated ethical principles and scientific integrity and breached Chinese regulations.
The twin babies and the pregnant volunteer will receive medical observation and follow-up visits, the officials said.

Health conditions of team members good, according to ROSCOSMOS
NUR SULTAN
Soyuz MS-15 capsule, which has been in the International Space Station (ISS) for six months, returned successfully to the World on Friday.
A capsule with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka, U.S. NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan made a touchdown in the Kazakh steppe near the city of Jezkazgan at 11.16 (06.16 GMT) local time.
The landing moment of the capsule was given live on the website of the Russian Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS).
It was seen on the live broadcast that while removing the team members from the capsule and performing health checks the search and rescue teams wore masks and maintained social distance.
The health conditions of the team members are good, according to ROSCOSMOS’s statement.
Russian cosmonauts Anatoliy Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy are still in the ISS.
The ISS is stationed in low Earth orbit and serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory for scientists to conduct experiments in various fields.
It is also a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids.

- Smoked turkey, cornbread dressing and Russian potatoes for space Thanksgiving
- The current station crew is made up of an American and two Russians
The crew of the International Space Station marked Thanksgiving with zero-gravity-friendly packets of smoked turkey, rehydrated cornbread dressing and a Russian side dish high above Earth.
U.S. astronaut Kevin Ford, the commander of the three-man Expedition 34 crew, showed off the menu in a NASA video. He said he and his Russian crew mates, Evgeny Tarelkin and Oleg Novitskiy, would eat the traditional meal in orbit, adding a Russian mashed-potato-and-onion dish to the American holiday's traditional favorites and washing it down with a cranberry-peach drink.
Ford, Tarelkin and Novitskiy arrived at the station in late October for a five-month stint. The previous crew returned home Sunday night -- but not without leaving behind a jar of marshmallow cream for Ford's candied yams.
Three additional members are slated to join the Expedition 34 crew in late December.",1
191,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/12/nasa-says-test-flight-new-megarocket-will-fly-without-crew1/,"NASA's new megarocket will launch without astronauts on its test flight, now delayed until 2019 because of technical challenges, the space agency's top leaders said Friday.
In February at the request of the White House, NASA began studying the possibility of putting a crew on the first flight. After reviewing the costs and risks, the space agency decided against it. The White House took part in the decision, said NASA's Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot.
Still in development, the super-sized Space Launch rocket is meant to eventually send astronauts to Mars. The first launch had been targeted for next year, but now won't happen until 2019 when NASA will send an unoccupied Orion capsule to the vicinity of the moon for a three-week trial run.
The second flight will have astronauts on board. It is scheduled for 2021, but will almost certainly be later because of all the delays with the first flight.
It would have cost a lot more money and time to add life-support systems and other human-required equipment for the test flight, said Bill Gerstenmaier, head of NASA's human explorations and operations.
""The best plan we have is actually the plan we're on right now,"" he said.
The test flight can be more dynamic, as NASA calls it, without a crew, and the lessons learned can help advance the next mission when people finally are on board.
Lightfoot said it would have been technically feasible to add a crew, given more funding, but decided to stay the course.
It would have cost an extra $600 million to $900 million to outfit the system for astronauts on the initial flight, Gerstenmaier said.
Earlier this week, NASA reported that a section of test hardware was damaged during manufacturing in New Orleans. No one was injured in the May 3 mishap. Technicians were lowering the dome for the bottom of a liquid oxygen tank, when the dome ended up ramming into a support structure. NASA is investigating.
Gerstenmaier called it ""an unfortunate event"" but said it shouldn't affect the schedule much.
Late last month, the U.S. Government Accountability Office warned that a delay was likely for the first SLS flight, crew or not. The current exploration effort will cost nearly $24 billion by the end of fiscal 2018, the GAO reported.
Lightfoot acknowledged that he and others are frustrated by the technical challenges that have slowed down the program. The agency is aiming for a sustainable program within the available resources, he said, not just a single-objective mission.
The Apollo moon program of the 1960s and early 1970s represented a sprint to a single destination, Gerstenmaier noted. The SLS rocket is meant to support flights to not only the moon and Mars, but the moons of Mars and even farther into the solar system, with potential commercial activity as well.
The megarocket represents a robust foundation for ultimately moving human presence out into the solar system, Gerstenmaier said.
""That's a grander vision in a way than just moving people to the moon for the first time, although that was a very special moment and a very special challenge for those teams moving forward. But we're building off of that legacy now to move in a more sustained manner,"" he said.
Earlier this year, SpaceX announced a bold mission to send two paying passengers on a flight around the moon in 2018. SpaceX chief Elon Musk also aims to colonize Mars.
""I've been saying it for a while. This is an 'and' proposition, this is not an 'or,'"" Lightfoot said. ""If you look at what we're trying to do, it's going to take really all of us, frankly, to get this done.""",1
192,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-genome-editing-idUSKBN15T24P,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Powerful gene editing tools may one day be used on human embryos, eggs and sperm to remove genes that cause inherited diseases, according to a report by U.S. scientists and ethicists released on Tuesday.
The report from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Academy of Medicine said scientific advances make gene editing in human reproductive cells “a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.”
The statement signals a softening in approach over the use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.
In December 2015, scientists and ethicists at an international meeting held at the NAS in Washington said it would be “irresponsible” to use gene editing technology in human embryos for therapeutic purposes, such as to correct genetic diseases, until safety and efficacy issues are resolved.
Though the technology is still not ready, the latest NAS report says clinical trials for genome editing of the human germline could be permitted, “but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.”
Such editing is not legal in the United States, and other countries have signed a convention prohibiting the practice on concerns it could be used to create so-called designer babies.
CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.
Genome editing is already being planned for use in clinical trials of people to correct diseases caused by a single gene mutation, such as sickle cell disease. But these therapies affect only the patient.
The concern is over use of the technology in human reproductive cells or early embryos because the changes would be passed along to offspring.
Research using the powerful technique is plowing ahead even as researchers from the University of California and the Broad Institute battle for control over the CRISPR patent.
Although gene editing of human reproductive cells to correct inherited diseases “must be approached with caution, caution does not mean prohibition,” the committee said in a statement.
Sarah Norcross of the Progress Educational Trust, which advocates for people affected by genetic conditions, called the recommendations “sensible and prudent.”
But Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society said they were “unsettling and disappointing,” arguing that they “constitute a green light for proceeding with efforts to modify the human germline” - changes that can be passed to future generations.

- Published
Nasa has announced that next month it will launch its first crewed mission from US soil in almost 10 years.
The rocket and the spacecraft it is carrying are due to take off from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center on 27 May, taking two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).
Both the rocket and spacecraft were developed by private company SpaceX.
Nasa has been using Russian rockets for crewed flights since its space shuttle was retired in 2011.
If successful, SpaceX – headed by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk - will become the first private firm to send Nasa astronauts into space.
The Falcon Nine rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft will take off from the space centre’s historic Pad 39A, the same one used for the Apollo and shuttle missions.
It will take astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley approximately 24 hours to reach the ISS.
One American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are currently aboard the ISS.",1
194,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/11/astronauts-return-iss-space-station-coronavirus,"Two Nasa astronauts expect a difficult return to a drastically changed world next week, after close to a year onboard the International Space Station.
Andrew Morgan told reporters the ISS crew had tried to keep abreast of news regarding the coronavirus pandemic, but it was hard to comprehend what was really going on and what to expect when his nine-month mission ends next Friday.
“It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” said Jessica Meir, who last year took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
“We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.”
As an emergency physician in the army, Morgan said he feels a little guilty coming back midway through the medical crisis.
“It’s very hard to fathom,” Morgan said.
Meir said it would be difficult not being able to hug family and friends after seven months off the planet. She expects to feel even more isolated on Earth than in space.
“We’re so busy with so many other amazing pursuits and we have this incredible vantage point of the Earth below, that we don’t really feel as much of that isolation,“ Meir said.
“So we’ll see how it goes and how I adjust. But it will, of course, be wonderful to see some family and friends, at least virtually and from a distance for now.”
Morgan flew to the space station last July, and Meir last September. They will return in a Soyuz capsule with Russian Oleg Skripochka, landing in Kazakhstan. Their departure will leave three astronauts, who arrived on Thursday, onboard.
The three astronauts will return to Earth exactly 50 years after the Apollo 13 crew splashed down in the Pacific ocean. An oxygen tank explosion aborted that moon-landing mission.
“Now there’s a crisis and the crisis is on Earth,” Morgan said.",1

The remote working stakes have just gone up a notch
All over the world people have been forced to adapt to the challenges of remote working because of coronavirus.
An organisation you might have thought would have no trouble adjusting to the new conditions is Nasa – whose remote operations go to the farthest reaches of the solar system and beyond.
However, with teams of scientists working from their homes instead of in their state-of-the-art Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, the controllers of the Curiosity rover on Mars have apparently had to resort to a disarmingly low-tech solution to continue to drive the vehicle over the red planet.
Instead of the usual high-tech goggles, the Curiosity team are currently using 50s-style red-green 3D glasses to view the terrain on Mars and guide the rover.
Nasa explained how the situation came about.
In a post on their website, the organisation said: “The team began to anticipate the need to go fully remote a couple weeks before [the coronavirus lockdown] leading them to rethink how they would operate. Headsets, monitors and other equipment were distributed (picked up curbside, with all employees following proper social-distancing measures).
“Not everything they’re used to working with at JPL could be sent home, however: Planners rely on 3D images from Mars and usually study them through special goggles that rapidly shift between left- and right-eye views to better reveal the contours of the landscape. That helps them figure out where to drive Curiosity and how far they can extend its robotic arm.
“But those goggles require the advanced graphics cards in high-performance computers at JPL (they’re actually gaming computers repurposed for driving on Mars). In order for rover operators to view 3D images on ordinary laptops, they’ve switched to simple red-blue 3D glasses.”
The space agency added: “Although not as immersive or comfortable as the goggles, they work just as well for planning drives and arm movements.”
After successfully setting up their remote operation – apparently requiring numerous simultaneous online video conference groups – the team has already successfully carried out a planned drilling operation on Mars.
Nasa's groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In picturesShow all 10
Curiosity science operations team chief Carrie Bridge said: “It’s classic, textbook Nasa.”
“We’re presented with a problem and we figure out how to make things work. Mars isn’t standing still for us – we’re still exploring.”

197,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/30/health/gene-edited-babies-he-jiankui-intl,"Hong Kong (CNN)Humanity was reluctantly dragged into a new era this week.
In a video posted on YouTube, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced to the world that he successfully used the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to modify the DNA of two embryos before birth, essentially creating the world's first genetically modified humans.
The news, delivered on the eve of a high-profile scientific meeting in Hong Kong on human gene editing, left the science community in shock. ""I see it as one of those moments that happens once every few decades,"" said William Hurlbut, Senior Research Scholar at Stanford University Medical Center's Department of Neurobiology. ""Where someone does something that so dramatically changes the landscape that the world will never be the same again.""
But the scientist who accomplished this history-altering feat was not celebrated nor lavished with praise. In fact, his whereabouts are currently unknown. He skipped out early of the very event where he presented his research amid calls for a probe into this work. The Chinese authorities have opened an ""immediate investigation"" into He and ordered those involved in the project to suspend their activities.
Editing the DNA of human embryos that go on to deliver has never been done before. And with good reason, scientists say. The technology is still in its infancy and could lead to a multitude of unknown genetic complications later in life.
Scientists have reached an understanding that implanting such an embryo is a boundary that shouldn't be crossed until the risks are reduced or eliminated. ""No one expected that someone would do this experiment on a human embryo,"" Feng Zhang, one of the inventors of the gene-editing technique CRISPR and member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard told CNN. ""The scientific community didn't actually know anything about what was going on.""
He, a professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said he was ""proud"" of his work that resulted in two ostensibly healthy twin girls born from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV. But he was condemned by his peers and the experiment was labeled ""monstrous,"" ""unethical,"" and a ""huge blow"" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research.
That He could tinker with life changing technology away from the eyes of regulators and purportedly even the university where he conducted the experiment, has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls for a globally binding code of conduct.
The case also places renewed scrutiny on China, a leader in the field of genome editing and biotechnology that has historically had a reputation for sidestepping ethical questions in favor of innovation.
But deeper questions are being asked as to whether it is now inevitable that this technology will be used in the future.
""Never before have humans had power like this over our own biology,"" Hurlbut said. ""We are now in the era of germline genetic engineering.""
'A wake up call'
Ultimately, genome editing shows huge promise in one day treating diseases that are currently untreatable, such as sickle cell disease, or cystic fibrosis. But scientists at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, where He appeared on Wednesday, overwhelmingly said the science needed to be made as effective and safe as possible -- and it was ""irresponsible"" to use germline editing in a clinical setting at this stage.
Germline gene-editing refers to genetic changes in every cell, that will be passed on to future generations. This is different to somatic (body) cell gene-editing, whereby only existing cells are targeted and the changes made are not passed on to future offspring.
Apart from raising ethical concerns, scientists said the gene He ""edited-out,"" called CCR5, is crucial to the human immune system, and removing it increases the risk of susceptibility to other diseases such as the West Nile virus and influenza. Other critics pointed to the fact that the procedure was not medically necessary as there are other treatments for HIV.
Making changes to an embryo could also have unknown consequences that could be passed down to future generations.
It was evident that He had not fully considered the potential long-term social effects on the twin girls. When one audience member at the summit asked whether He had thought about how the girls would see themselves and how they would be treated by society, he replied: ""I don't know how to answer this question.""
Scientists at the summit pointed out that He's approach to the study had been flawed from start to finish, in particular the way he obtained informed consent from the parents -- a process that took place over just two sessions lasting a total of three hours, and without an independent third party to properly explain the risks and benefits.
He's research has prompted scientists to call for greater transparency and some form of global governance in the field.
""There has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community because of the lack of transparency,"" said Conference Chairman and Nobel laureate David Baltimore on Wednesday.
'A gold rush on new kind of knowledge'
That the announcement of the world's first genetically edited babies came out of China is perhaps not surprising.
Chinese scientists have accomplished many firsts in the genome world, including the first CRISPR-edited monkeys, the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans, and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos.
China has also pumped huge amounts of government money into gene-editing technology, using it to lure leading Chinese scientists living abroad back to the country, as well as foreigners who see the country as fertile ground for this kind of research.
""I just think right now China is a lot more driven, they incentivize their scientists to move faster and be bolder and it shows,"" said Victor J. Dzau, President of the Institute of Medicine at the US National Academy of Medicine.
Last year, China spent a record 1.76 trillion yuan ($254 billion) on research and development, and the country is catching up with the US' investment in the same area, spurring a genetic arms race that has been labeled ""Sputnik 2.0"" by Dr. Carl June, an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.
And Chinese regulators appear more open to the new tech than its US counterparts. As of the end of February 2018, there were nine registered clinical studies testing CRISPR-edited cells to treat various cancers and HIV infection in China, according to Goldman Sachs analysis in April. That's compared to one in the US after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its hold on the first US-based human CRISPR trial in October.
""It's clear that this is the new frontier,"" said Hervé Chneiweiss of France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. ""It's clearly the gold rush on any kind of new knowledge that could be translated into new treatments.""
Many of these treatments exist in a legal gray area. Currently, each country has their own rules and regulations surrounding gene-editing. China has several loosely-worded regulations restricting experimental science, including rules on embryo research. A 2003 directive to in-vitro clinics by the Chinese Ministry of Health barred ""clinical experiments"" that ""violate ethical or moral principles.""
""The problem is there are no penalties"" if the guidelines are breached, said Renzong Qiu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
In an effort to show the world that China is holding up ethical standards, the nation's vice minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Xu Nanping, said Thursday that He had ""brazenly violated Chinese laws and regulations and breached the science ethics bottom line.""
Both the hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, and the university he is affiliated with, deny involvement in the procedures. And in a joint statement issued Monday, more than 120 Chinese scientists condemned the research, saying that ""directly experimenting on humans is nothing but crazy.""
""There's a misconception that the advance in research must necessarily come with being more flexible with respect to regulation,"" said David R Liu, professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University, who has pioneered improving versions of CRISPR. ""I caution that people should not take away from recent news that China is being less vigilant or less caring about these ethical breaches than any other country.""
In the short term, perhaps the greatest risk of misuse is not so much direct harm to people but the potentially chilling effect on legitimate research should governments and regulators push for greater restrictions.",0

Washington (AFP) - A SpaceX rocket will send two American astronauts to the International Space Station on May 27, NASA announced on Friday, the first crewed spaceflight from the US in nearly a decade.
""On May 27, @NASA will once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil!"" Jim Bridenstine, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in a tweet
Since July 2011, the United States has relied on Russian Soyuz rockets to send American astronauts to the ISS.
The US space agency had been aiming to conduct the crewed mission in May and is sticking with the plan despite the global coronavirus pandemic.
Astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley will fly to the ISS on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft also built by SpaceX, the company founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.
They will lift off at 4:32 pm (2032 GMT) on May 27 from historic launch pad 39A, the same one used for the Apollo and space shuttle missions, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said.
Behnken and Hurley have been training for years for the mission, which would move the United States closer to no longer being reliant on Russia for crewed flights.
The Crew Dragon capsule is a modified version of SpaceX's Dragon capsule which has been used to send supplies to the ISS since 2012.
It will take approximately 24 hours after liftoff for them to dock with the ISS. The length of their stay aboard the ISS has not been determined.
One American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are currently aboard the ISS.
The May mission will be a milestone for NASA, which has had trouble turning the page on the space shuttle era. Shuttles transported American astronauts into space for three decades but two of them also blew up.
After abandoning the shuttle, NASA turned to private industry to develop its next generation spacecraft and SpaceX and Boeing have been competing on rolling out a crewed capsule.
SpaceX came up with Crew Dragon and Boeing the Starliner but the Starliner suffered a setback in December during a test run.
SpaceX is now poised to become the first private company to send astronauts into space.
In March, Musk's Crew Dragon capsule made a round trip to the ISS, which is in orbit more than 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, with a mannequin on board, before returning to the Atlantic after six days in space.
SpaceX has made the trip 15 times since 2012, but only to refuel the station.",1

MOSCOW – An engine snag has delayed the arrival of a Russian spacecraft carrying three astronauts to the International Space Station until Thursday.
A rocket carrying Russians Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev and American Steve Swanson to the space station blasted off successfully early Wednesday from the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
The Soyuz booster rocket lifted off as scheduled at 3:17 a.m. local time Wednesday (2117 GMT Tuesday). It entered a designated orbit about 10 minutes after the launch and was expected to reach the space station in six hours. All onboard systems were working flawlessly, and the crew was feeling fine.
NASA and Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, said shortly before the planned docking that the arrival had been delayed after a 24-second engine burn that was necessary to adjust the Soyuz spacecraft's orbiting path ""did not occur as planned.""
The crew is in no danger, but will have to wait until Thursday for the Soyuz TMA-12M to arrive and dock at the space station, NASA said. The arrival is now scheduled for 7:58 EDT (2358 GMT) Thursday.
Roscosmos chief Oleg Ostapenko said on Wednesday that the glitch occurred because of a failure of the ship's orientation system. The crew is in good spirits and they have taken off their space suits to prepare for the long flight, Ostapenko said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.
The Russian official said the crew is now working to adjust the spacecraftt to the right orbit to make it for the Thursday docking.
Russian spacecraft used to routinely travel two days to reach the orbiting laboratory before last year. Wednesday would have been only the fifth time that a crew would have taken the six-hour ""fast-track"" route to the station.
NASA said that Moscow flight control has yet to determine why the engine burn did not occur.
The three astronauts traveling in the Soyuz will be greeted by Japan's Koichi Wakata, NASA's Rick Mastracchio and Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, who have been at the station since November. Wakata is the first Japanese astronaut to lead the station. The new crew is scheduled to stay in orbit for six months.
The joint mission is taking place at a time when U.S.-Russian relations on Earth are at their lowest ebb in decades, but the U.S. and Russia haven't allowed their disagreements over Ukraine to get in the way of their cooperation in space.
Swanson is a veteran of two U.S. space shuttle missions, and Skvortsov spent six months at the space outpost in 2010. Artemyev is on his first flight to space.
So far, the tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine have been kept at bay. Since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft as the only means to ferry crew to the orbiting outpost and back.
The U.S. is paying Russia nearly $71 million per seat to fly astronauts to the space lab through 2017. It's doing that at a time when Washington has led calls for sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine following a hastily-arranged referendum. So far the sanctions have been limited and haven't directly targeted the wider Russian economy.
Earlier this month, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden repeatedly said the conflict in Ukraine would have no effect on what's going on in space between the U.S. and Russia, saying that the ""partnership in space remains intact and normal.""
At the same time, Bolden said on his blog Tuesday that while NASA continues to cooperate successfully with Russia, it wants to quickly get its own capacity to launch crews. NASA is trying to speed up private American companies' efforts to launch crews into orbit, but it needs extra funding to do so.

(Reuters) - Astronauts returned to the U.S. side of the International Space Station on Wednesday after sheltering most of the day in Russia’s modules while ground teams assessed a potential ammonia leak, NASA said.
Wearing masks as a precaution, astronauts opened the hatch between the Russian and U.S. section at 3:05 p.m. EST (2005 GMT), about 11 hours after an alarm raised concerns about a possible leak of the toxic substance.
“No indication of ammonia,” said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. “Crew doffed their masks and are getting about their evening business.”
U.S. station commander Butch Wilmore, NASA flight engineer Terry Virts and Samantha Cristoforetti, a flight engineer with the European Space Agency, left the U.S. side at around 4 a.m. (0900 GMT) and joined their three Russian colleagues in the Russian half of the orbital outpost, a research laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth.
Mike Suffredini, the station program manager in Houston, said the evacuation reflected initial concerns that ammonia may have escaped from one of two cooling loops used to dissipate heat from water lines.
“There was never any risk to the crew,” he added.
After the alarm, the astronauts put on masks, moved to the Russian side and closed hatches between the modules. Later they returned to the U.S. lab, but evacuated a second time after rising air pressure indicated a threat might still be present.
Later analysis showed a computer glitch triggered several false readings, tricking the station’s software into setting off the alarm, said NASA associate administrator Bill Gerstenmaier.
The crew was about two hours into their workday when they retreated to the Russian section. They had planned to spend Wednesday unpacking a Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon cargo capsule that arrived on Monday and setting up new scientific experiments.
The station, staffed by rotating crews of six astronauts and cosmonauts, is a project involving 15 nations, led by the United States and Russia. It has been permanently occupied since November 2000.

* Hadfield to oversee SpaceX Dragon capsule departure
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., March 13 (Reuters) - Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield took the helm of the International Space Station on Wednesday, only the second time in the outpost’s 12-year history that command has been turned over to someone who is not American or Russian.
“It’s a huge honor and a privilege for me, but also for all the people at the Canadian Space Agency and for my entire country,” Hadfield, 53, said during a change of command ceremony aboard the station broadcast on NASA Television.
“Thank you very much for giving me the keys to the family car,” Hadfield told outgoing station commander Kevin Ford, who is due to depart on Thursday along with Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin.
“We’re going to put some miles on it, but we’ll bring it back in good shape,” Hadfield said.
Ford, Novitskiy and Tarelkin have been aboard the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, since October.
Command of the station, a project of 15 nations that has been permanently staffed since November 2000, normally rotates between primary partners United States and Russia.
But in May 2009, Belgian astronaut Frank De Winne became the first station commander from the European Space Agency.
Hadfield, a veteran of two space shuttle missions, is the station’s first Canadian commander.
Hadfield will be part of a three-man skeleton crew until NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and cosmonauts Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin arrive later this month.
Hadfield, astronaut Thomas Marshburn and cosmonaut Roman Romanenko have been aboard the station since Dec. 21. They are due to return to Earth on May 13.
Among Hadfield’s first duties as commander is overseeing the packing and release of the visiting Space Exploration Technologies’ Dragon cargo capsule. The capsule, making a second resupply run for NASA, is due to depart the station on March 25.
Hadfield has taken to Twitter to share his experiences in orbit with short messages and pictures dispatched several times a day. His followers now number more than 512,000.
“My heartfelt congratulations to Commander Hadfield and his family on what is an important milestone for all Canadians,” Canada’s Industry Minister Christian Paradis said in a statement. (Editing by Kevin Gray and Phil Berlowitz)",1

- Valve problems leads to scrubbing of Orion test launch
- NASA now hopes to launch Orion on Friday
- Orion would orbit Earth twice and will splash down in the Pacific
NASA will have to wait at least one more day to see how its new Orion spacecraft flies.
The space agency scrubbed Thursday morning's test launch in Florida after a series of delays, the last of which happened because some liquid-oxygen fuel and drain valves failed to open during the countdown, NASA said.
The launch tentatively has been rescheduled for 7:05 a.m. ET Friday.
The launch of Orion -- a craft designed to eventually explore deep space -- is to be one of NASA's biggest moments since the shuttle era ended in 2011.
NASA spent most of Thursday morning's nearly 2½-hour launch window trying to work out various obstacles and kinks before scrubbing the launch around 9:40 a.m. ET. The first delay involved a boat that came too close to the launch area; more delays came because of wind gusts.
When the countdown resumed, valves failed to open in the boosters, eventually leading to the scrubbing.
A new beginning
NASA hopes Orion will usher in a new era: Eventual human exploration of deep space.
""We haven't had this feeling in awhile, since the end of the shuttle program,"" Mike Sarafin, Orion flight director at Johnson Space Center, said in a preflight briefing on Wednesday.
Orion looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon: to an asteroid and eventually to Mars.
""It is, I think, consistent with those -- the beginning of shuttle and beginning of Apollo,"" said Mark Geyer, NASA Orion program manager. ""I think it's in the same category.""
When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days. Orion's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and Apollo was 12.8 feet in diameter, NASA said.
Orion is expected to take up its first crew in 2021.
During this test flight, Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and will orbit Earth twice. Four and half hours later, it will splash down in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California. Two U.S. Navy ships, the amphibious transport dock ship USS Anchorage and the Military Sealift Command rescue and salvage ship USNS Salvor, will help NASA recover the capsule.
Once in orbit, Orion should send back some amazing pictures of Earth, NASA said. If the weather cooperates, NASA said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown.
Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty. It will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime-sized microchip.
""Sesame Street"" is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight, including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky.
Also going up: an oxygen hose from an Apollo 11 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil. A Tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the Denver Science Museum will be on board and lockers will be filled with flags, coins, patches, poetry and music.",1

- One American and two Russians will land just before midnight
- Russian Soyuz space modules have proven very reliable
- It is the standard transportation mode to the ISS after a deadly space shuttle crash
Nearly five months of cramped living in zero gravity will come to an end Thursday for one American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station.
Their Soyuz capsule is set to undock at 8:30 p.m. ET, and land less than three and a half hours later in Kazakhstan.
Soyuz modules are vital to the Russian space program.
They are launched into space as capsules atop a rocket, and are capable of landing on land, not requiring a body of water to splash down in.
A Soyuz carried the first ever crew to the ISS in November 2000, according to NASA. One is docked there at all times, in case the crew needs to leave in an emergency.
It became the standard mode of transportation to the station after the deadly 2003 Columbia space shuttle accident.
The modern version, the Soyuz TMA, is made of three parts. Two of them jettison then burn upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere, according to NASA. Only the Descent Module will land on Earth, carrying Commander Kevin Ford of NASA, Russian Soyuz Commander Oleg Novitskiy and Russian Flight Engineer Evgeny Tarelkin.
NASA TV will broadcast the undocking and landing live.
The undocking of the Soyuz will mark the beginning of the 35th ISS mission, which awaits the arrival of two more Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut in two weeks.
The journey up to the station takes longer than the return trip to Earth, NASA said. The Soyuz needs a total of two days to catch up with the ISS in its orbit.",1

BEIJING — China said on Thursday that it had suspended the work of a scientist who claims to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies, saying his conduct appeared to be unethical and in violation of Chinese law.
The scientist, He Jiankui, announced on Monday that he had used the gene-editing technique Crispr to alter embryos, which he implanted in the womb of a woman who gave birth to twin girls this month. At an international conference on Wednesday, he asserted that he was proud of what he had done.
Xu Nanping, China’s vice minister of science and technology, said Dr. He’s work was still being investigated. But based on news reports, he said, Dr. He appeared to have “blatantly violated China’s relevant laws and regulations” and broken “the bottom line of morality and ethics that the academic community adheres to,” the state broadcaster China Central Television reported on Thursday.
“It is shocking and unacceptable,” Mr. Xu was quoted as saying. “We are resolutely opposed to it.”
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]
The suspension follows international condemnation from scientists who maintain that Dr. He’s conduct was unethical. They say there are serious unanswered questions about the safety of embryo editing and a need to make sure that such research is conducted in a transparent, monitored way so the technology is not misused.
Mr. Xu had said earlier that Chinese regulations issued in 2003 permitted gene-editing experiments on embryos for research purposes, but only if they remained viable for no more than 14 days.
On Monday, a group of 122 Chinese scientists issued a statement calling Dr. He’s actions “crazy” and his claims “a huge blow to the global reputation and development of Chinese science.”
At the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Dr. He acknowledged that he had not made his university in China aware of the research he was doing. He said he had initially paid for the research himself, then later from his university funding.
Dr. He pushed back against suggestions that he had been secretive about his work, saying that he had presented preliminary aspects of it at conferences and consulted with scientists in the United States and elsewhere. He said he had submitted his research to a scientific journal for review and had not expected to be presenting it at the conference.
One of many areas of confusion about Dr. He’s research was the status of a possible pregnancy of a second woman he said he had implanted with an edited embryo. On Wednesday, under questioning from scientists after his talk, Dr. He said there had been a second implantation in an early stage.
When asked by Robin Lovell-Badge, a professor of genetics and embryology at the Francis Crick Institute in London, whether by early stage Dr. He meant a “chemical pregnancy” or early miscarriage, Dr. He said “yes.”
On Thursday, however, Dr. Lovell-Badge told reporters that he could not be sure that Dr. He understood that “chemical pregnancy” referred to a pregnancy that was lost.
“He doesn’t necessarily know what he’s talking about,” Dr. Lovell-Badge said. “We don’t know. He said he confirmed that essentially they’d done the hormone test for whether or not the woman was pregnant. And the answer is yes. But it’s very early, so it could turn into a chemical pregnancy meaning there was a miscarriage. Many embryos fail to survive.”
Dr. He had been scheduled to speak again at the conference on Thursday, but his talk was canceled.
Dr. Robin Lovell-Badge, who moderated the Wednesday session, said in an email that “it would have been difficult to have sufficient security” for a second talk. He said that Dr. He had decided not to attend after he was told about the security arrangements.
Dr. Lovell-Badge said Thursday that the organizers had felt it was “important to give Dr. He a platform to present what he had done.”
“We therefore do not regret at all allowing him to present yesterday, but giving him a second opportunity today might also have been viewed as support for him,” he said. “This is another reason the committee did not want him back today.”",0

""Mission-essential personnel will continue to be granted access onsite,"" he added.

He Jiankui, who shocked the scientific community last year by announcing the birth of twin girls whose genes had allegedly been altered to confer immunity to HIV, was also fined three million yuan ($430,000), Xinhua news agency said.
He, who was educated at Stanford University, was sentenced by a court in Shenzhen for ""illegally carrying out the human embryo gene-editing intended for reproduction"", Xinhua said.
Two of his fellow researchers were also sentenced. Zhang Renli was handed a two-year jail term and fined one million yuan while Qin Jinzhou was given 18 months, suspended for two years, and fined 500,000 yuan.
The trio had not obtained qualifications to work as doctors and had knowingly violated China's regulations and ethical principles, according to the court verdict, Xinhua said.
They had acted ""in the pursuit of personal fame and gain"" and seriously ""disrupted medical order"", it said.
The researchers had forged ethical review materials and recruited couples where the husband was HIV positive for their gene-editing experiments.
The trial was held behind closed doors as the case related to ""personal privacy"", Xinhua said.
He's gene-editing experiments resulted in two pregnancies -- the twin girls and third baby which had not previously been confirmed, it said.
He announced in November last year that the world's first gene-edited babies -- the twins -- had been born that month after he altered their DNA to prevent them from contracting HIV by deleting a certain gene under a technique known as CRISPR.
Days later, He, a former associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, told a biomedical conference in Hong Kong he was ""proud"" of his gene-editing work.
- 'Not safe' -
The claim shocked scientists worldwide, raising questions about bioethics and putting a spotlight on China's lax oversight of scientific research.
""That technology is not safe,"" said Kiran Musunuru, a genetics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, explaining that the CRISPR molecular ""scissors"" often cut next to the targeted gene, causing unexpected mutations.
""It's very easy to do if you don't care about the consequences,"" Musunuru said.
Amid the outcry, He was placed under police investigation, the government ordered a halt to his research work and he was fired by his Chinese university.
Gene-editing for reproductive purposes is illegal in most countries. China's health ministry issued regulations in 2003 prohibiting gene-editing of human embryos, though the procedure is allowed for ""non-reproductive purposes"".
He's gene editing meant to immunise the twins against HIV may have failed in its purpose and created unintended mutations, scientists said earlier this month after the original research was published for the first time.
He claimed a medical breakthrough that could ""control the HIV epidemic"", but it was not clear whether he had even been successful in immunising the babies against the virus because the team did not reproduce the gene mutation that confers this resistance, scientists told the MIT Technology Review.
While the team targeted the right gene, they did not replicate the ""Delta 32"" variation required, instead creating novel edits whose effects are not clear.
Moreover, CRISPR remains an imperfect tool because it can lead to unwanted or ""off-target"" edits, making its use in humans hugely controversial.
In 2015, a UN bioethics committee called for a stop to human embryo gene editing for fears it could be used to modify the human race.
But a year later Britain granted scientists permission to edit embryo DNA in research on the causes of infertility and miscarriages.
And in 2017, a US science advisory committee said such modification should be allowed in future to eliminate disease.
In November this year the World Health Organization said it would create a global registry to track research into human genetic manipulation following the backlash to He's announcement.

As its name implies, Demo-2 will be the second time the company launches its Crew Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. But, unlike Demo-1 last year, this time two astronauts will be on board – a pair that will be the first NASA astronauts to launch from the U.S. since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.

209,https://www.france24.com/en/20190417-nasa-astronaut-set-record-longest-spaceflight-woman,"NASA astronaut Christina Koch is going to have her mission on the International Space Station (ISS) extended to nearly 11 months, which would set a record for the longest spaceflight by a woman, the US space agency said Wednesday.
Koch, 40, arrived on the ISS on March 14 with two other crew members -- an American and a Russian -- for what was initially planned to be a six-month mission.
The two other astronauts will return to Earth on October 3 but Koch's stay would be extended until February 2020, which would beat the record held by another female US astronaut, Peggy Whitson, who spent 288 days aboard the ISS in 2016-17, NASA said.
""It feels awesome,"" Koch said when told her mission was being prolonged. ""I have known that this was a possibility for a long time and it's truly a dream come true.""
Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of NASA's Human Research Program, said Koch's extended mission would provide additional data about the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body and ""support future missions to the Moon and Mars.""
The record for an extended spaceflight by an American is held by US astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent 340 days aboard the ISS in 2015-16 with Russian Mikhail Kornienko.
The longest ever spaceflight was by Russia's Valery Polyakov, who spent 14 months aboard the Mir space station in 1994-95.
The current team aboard the ISS is made up of three Americans -- Koch, Anne McClain and Nick Hague -- two Russians -- Oleg Kononenko and Alexey Ovchinin -- and a Canadian, David Saint-Jacques.
Between June and September, several astronauts will return to Earth and be replaced by others, including an Italian, Luca Parmitano, and the first ever astronaut from the United Arab Emirates, Hazzaa Ali Almansoori, who will spend about a week in space.
Astronauts are currently flown to and from the ISS using Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. US manufacturers SpaceX and Boeing are developing their own transports and those are scheduled to be ready by the end of the year.
The ISS -- a rare area of cooperation between Moscow and Washington -- has been orbiting the Earth since 1998.

NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine announced that Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama would be moving to Stage 3 in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic shaking the globe.
Stage 3 is ""mandatory telework status,"" Bridenstine said in a release on NASA's website, adding that there is ""restricted access to the center until further notice."" The government space agency recently received confirmation that an employee at Marshall Space Flight Center has tested positive for COVID-19.
The decision was made ""out of an abundance of caution,"" with all other NASA centers moving to Stage 2, where ""telework is strongly encouraged for employees who can work directly.""
CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: WHERE DOES IT STAND?
The Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Ala. is the agency's civilian rocketry and spacecraft propulsion research center and is the largest center in NASA. It was responsible for developing the Saturn launch vehicles in the Apollo space program.
Bridenstine's announcement comes after an employee at NASA's Ames Research Center in California tested positive for COVID-19. Ames Research Center is also in Stage 3 ""mandatory telework status.""
The agency provided an update on how it would handle its coronavirus plans last week in light of the positive test.
NASA's Bridenstine said the agency's leadership continues to coordinate ""closely with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and interagency partners in our nation’s unified response to coronavirus (COVID-19), and regularly re-evaluating the conditions at each center.""
“The vigilance our workforce has displayed in our response to coronavirus is remarkable and has placed our agency in a position of strength as we confront this national emergency,"" Bridenstine added. ""I’m grateful for all the members of the NASA community and everything they’re doing to care for the health of our workforce and keeping the mission going. We will get through this together and NASA will continue to accomplish amazing things for our country and all of humanity.”

211,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/health/genetic-editing-he-speaks-int,"Hong Kong (CNN)The Chinese scientist who sparked an international outcry after alleging to have helped create the world's first genetically edited babies has raised the possibility of a third child being born, after announcing that a separate woman was pregnant at an early stage with a modified embryo.
Speaking in front of a packed hall of about 700 people Wednesday at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, He Jiankui publicly defended his work, saying he felt ""proud"" of his achievement.
He, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, sent shock waves through the scientific community on Monday when he announced in a video online that two ostensibly healthy twin girls had been born this month from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV.
""For this specific case, I feel proud. I feel proudest, because they had lost hope for life,"" He said Wednesday of the parents of the twins, the father of whom is believed to carry HIV. ""But with this protection, [the father] sent a message saying he will work hard, earn money and take care of his two daughters and his wife.""
Asked whether his clinical trials had resulted in other pregnancies, He replied, ""there is another one, another potential pregnancy.""
The academic did not disclose any further details regarding the possibility of a third genetically edited baby, other than answering ""yes"" when asked whether the pregnancy was still in an early stage.
He said his research has been submitted to a scientific journal for review, without naming the publication, and apologized for the result leaking ""unexpectedly.""
Ethical concerns
He's research has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls for a globally binding code of conduct.
In an question-and-answer session after the presentation, He said he conducted two rounds of informed consent with the parents, lasting a total of three hours.
""The simple fact that he was directly involved in trying to get consent from the patients is a huge problem,"" said Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute, who moderated the discussion with He. ""You should never do that. You should have an independent third party who can properly explain the risks and the benefits.""
According to He, the volunteers were found through an HIV/AIDS volunteer group.
Other concerns have focused on the CCR5 gene, which scientists at the conference said is crucial to the human immune system. Removing it increases the risk of susceptibility for other diseases such as the West Nile virus and influenza.
""When you change one thing, something else gets changed, too,"" said Feng Zhang, one of the inventors of the gene-editing technique CRISPR.
However, many of those in attendance at the Hong Kong conference have pointed out that while He has not necessarily contravened any international regulations, his purported use of CRISPR represents a clear break with convention.
""There's a fairly tight consensus from what is and is not acceptable in genome editing as of now, and He's reported work represents a departure from that,"" said David R. Liu, professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University, who has pioneered improving versions of CRISPR.
The conference, which is attended by leaders in the fields of genetics and ethics as well as policy-makers, is expected to issue a statement on the development during its closing session Thursday.
After He's presentation, conference Chairman David Baltimore said the research was not medically necessary, as there are other treatments for HIV. Baltimore criticized He's lack of transparency and referred to an agreement made at the 2015 conference that said it would be irresponsible to use such gene editing until safety issues had been dealt with.
China a leading player
China has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, bankrolling research into a number of world ""firsts,"" including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene-editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.
Last year, China spent a record 1.76 trillion yuan ($254 billion) on research and development, and the country is catching up with the US's investment in the same area, spurring a genetic arms race that has been labeled ""Sputnik 2.0"" by Dr. Carl June, an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.
However, in a joint statement issued Monday, more than 120 Chinese scientists condemned He's use of the CRISPR-Cas9 tool as a ""huge blow"" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research.
""It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientists who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics,"" they wrote, adding that ""directly experimenting on human is nothing but crazy ... as soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring, as the modified inheritable substance will inevitably blend into human genome pool.""
The Chinese government has also ordered an ""immediate investigation"" into He's claims.
The government investigation follows moves by both the hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, and the university he is affiliated with, to deny involvement in the procedures.
In a separate development on Wednesday, Rice University said it was investigating bioengineering professor Michael Deem after he was quoted in media reports as having been involved with He's work.
Deem was He's adviser at Rice for more than three years and published three papers with He.
""This research raises troubling scientific, legal and ethical questions,"" said Doug Miller, director of Rice University's media relations team. In a statement, Miller said Rice had ""no knowledge of this work.""
Unknown consequences
At the forefront of global concerns is that gene-editing technology is still in its infancy and there could be huge unknown consequences of using it in human embryos that go on to deliver.
The potential for long-term social effects on the girls was of particular concern at the Hong Kong summit, with one audience member asking whether He had thought about how the girls would see themselves and how they would be treated by society.
""I don't know how to answer this question,"" He said.
Jennifer Doudna, professor of chemistry and molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and one of the co-inventors of CRISPR, said she felt ""physically sick"" during He's presentation. ""To see this work being presented and performed the way it was, it was really inappropriate. And it affects two girls,"" she said.
""I hope this is a wake-up call for everybody to recognize that while this technology is incredibly exciting, this is an important moment where we need to grapple with responsibility of managing this technology going forward.""

Despite ethical concerns, a recent study suggested that the Chinese public is broadly in favor of using gene editing for medical purposes. An online survey conducted by Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou found that more than two-thirds of the 4,771 people surveyed (575 of whom reportedly have HIV) supported its use in treating diseases, according to the state-run tabloid Global Times.
Chinese people ""have a high willingness to use of gene in disease prevention and treatment,"" Liang Chen, a professor at Sun Yat-Sen University, was quoted as saying. ""This suggests that the research of gene editing in China not only has a promising potential but also is responding to the public's needs.""",0
212,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/10029477/Russia-charges-Nasa-70m-per-seat-to-fly-astronauts-into-space.html,"Nasa announced its latest contract with the Russian Space Agency on Tuesday. The $424 million represents flights to and from the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft, as well as training, for six astronauts in 2016 and the first half of 2017.
That's $70.6 million per seat - well above the previous price tag of about $65 million.
Russia currently provides the only means of getting people to and from the space station, and its ticket prices have soared with each new contract. The six seats included in the latest contract covers not only Americans but European, Canadian or Japanese astronauts under barter agreements between NASA and those countries.
Several US companies are working on rockets and spacecraft to launch Americans from US soil. But that's still a few years away. The ability to launch crews into orbit from the US ended with Nasa's shuttle program in 2011. Even before the shuttles retired, the U.S. had been relying on Russia to transport long-term residents to the space station.
Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden said if Congress had approved the space agency's request for more funding for its commercial space effort, the latest contract would have been unnecessary. He is urging full funding of the Obama administration's 2014 budget request of $821 million for the commercial crew program.
""Because the funding for the President's plan has been significantly reduced, we now won't be able to support American launches until 2017,"" Mr Bolden, a former shuttle commander, wrote in a Nasa blog.
It could take longer if Congress does not fully support the 2014 request, he said.
""Further delays in our Commercial Crew Program and its impact on our human spaceflight program are unacceptable,"" Mr Bolden said.
The U.S.-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, already is making cargo shipments to the space station. Its founder and chief designer, billionaire Elon Musk, has said his company could be ferrying astronauts aboard improved versions of its Dragon capsules by 2015.
U.S.-based Orbital Sciences Corp. completed a successful test launch 1½ weeks ago. It plans to start sending supplies to the space station this summer, but it has no interest in carrying passengers.

More than 100 scientists said in an open letter the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in China.
In videos posted online, scientist He Jiankui defended what he said he had achieved - embryonic gene editing to help protect twin baby girls born this month from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
“Pandora’s box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before it’s too late,” the scientists said in their letter, a copy of which was posted by the Chinese news website the Paper.
“The biomedical ethics review for this so-called research exists in name only. Conducting direct human experiments can only be described as crazy,” the approximately 120 scientists said in the Chinese-language letter.
Yang Zhengang, a Fudan University professor, told Reuters he signed the letter because gene editing was “very dangerous”.
China’s Genetics Society and the Chinese Society for Stem Cell Research said in a statement He had acted as an “individual” and his work posed “tremendous safety risks for the research subjects”.
“We believe the research led by He is strongly against both the Chinese regulations and the consensus reached by the international science community,” the two groups said in a statement posted online.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut-and-paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are also concerns about its safety and ethics.
(Graphic explaining the Crispr DNA editing technique, tmsnrt.rs/2ReKG1R)
He, who is due to speak at a summit on human genome editing at the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Shenzhen Harmonicare Hospital, listed on China’s online clinical trial registry as having given ethical approval for He’s experiment, denied having ever taken part in any clinical operations relating to “gene-edited babies”.
The signatures on the online form were suspected of having been forged and “no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”, Hong Kong-listed Harmonicare Medical Holdings said in a statement.
‘VERY SHOCKED’
The Southern University of Science and Technology, where He holds an associate professorship, also said it had been unaware of the research project and that He had been on leave without pay since February.
The Shenzhen City Science and Innovation Committee, a municipal fund which was also listed on the clinical trial registry as having backed the trial, said in a statement on Monday it had never been involved in the project.
Xu Nanping, vice minister of China’s science and technology ministry, told reporters he was “very shocked” on hearing He’s claim, adding that such work had been prohibited since 2003.
Details of the case were still unclear, Xu said.
“We don’t know if this work is real or fake. If it’s real, then this is certainly banned in China.”
The official Xinhua news agency said ethics could not be ignored.
“Scientific exploration is never-ending ... but this does not mean that the morals of science can be abandoned or that ethical standards can be ignored,” the news agency said in a comment posted on social media.
The National Health Commission said on Monday it was “highly concerned” and had ordered provincial health officials “to immediately investigate and clarify the matter”.
The government’s medical ethics committee in Shenzhen said it was investigating the case, as was the Guangdong provincial health commission, according to Southern Metropolis Daily, a state media outlet.
The committee organizing the Hong Kong conference where He is due to speak - the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing - said in a statement on Monday it had only just been informed of He’s work on the genes of the twin girls.
“Our goal is to help ensure that human genome editing research be pursued responsibly,” the committee said.

Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be on board the historic flight, which will see SpaceX’s vehicle fly them to the International Space Station for the very first time.
One preparatory step for that launch happened on April 3, with a full run-through of the emergency egress system that will be in place during Demo-2 launch day to ensure that astronauts and ground crew can all quickly and safely get clear of the launchpad in case anything goes wrong. It’s highly unlikely that the system will actually be used, but safety is the name of the game in human spaceflight, and so NASA and SpaceX conducted a full demonstration with crew and support staff at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prove that everything works as intended.
As you can see in the video above, the system includes essentially loading crew from the launch tower into what amounts to a biplane system, with baskets they ride in to reach armored vehicles at ground level. They’re loaded into those, which are technically called Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (explosion-resistant, naturally), and then those take them to a safe distance.
Part of the demonstration exercise included simulating crew injuries among the support staff, with other team members having to locate them and carry them to the baskets for evacuation. Everything seems to have gone to plan, and this means that May window for this groundbreaking SpaceX mission is looking more solid than ever.",1

- Published
Three new crew members have arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) after a launch carried out under tight restrictions due to the coronavirus.
The Russian Soyuz rocket carrying cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner and Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy took off from Kazakhstan on Thursday.
Pre-launch protocols were changed to prevent the virus being taken to the ISS.
Only essential personnel were allowed at the launch site for the blast-off.
Support workers wore masks and kept their distance as the crew walked to the bus to take them to the spacecraft.
Earlier, Chris Cassidy said not having their families in Baikonur to cheer them on for the launch had affected the crew, but he added: ""We understand that the whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.
Following the launch Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted his congratulations.
Chris Cassidy, Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner are safely in orbit. No virus is stronger than the human desire to explore. I’m grateful to the entire @NASA and @roscosmos teams for their dedication to making this launch a success. https://t.co/LX36JhD5Fp— Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) April 9, 2020
The three will replace Oleg Skripochka, Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir who are due to make their return journey from the ISS on 17 April.
ISS crew routinely go into quarantine ahead of launch day, but because of the coronavirus pandemic the process began even earlier last month.
Traditional pre-launch fanfare and visits to Moscow were abandoned as the three - along with their reserve crew - stayed in isolation at Russia's Star City training centre outside the capital.
A final press conference at Baikonur was made - as usual - from behind a glass wall as an added barrier to infection.

* Cosmonaut Valery Polyakov spent 438 days in orbit
* Longest flight by U.S. astronaut is 215 days
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Oct 4 (Reuters) - NASA is considering doubling the amount of time an astronaut spends at the International Space Station to a year, laying the groundwork for future missions deeper into space, officials said Thursday.
If approved, a mission likely would begin in 2015, said NASA spokesman Rob Navias.
Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported this week that the experimental yearlong endurance mission would include a Russian cosmonaut and a NASA astronaut.
“If the mission proves to be effective, we will discuss sending yearlong missions ... on a permanent basis,” Alexei Krasnov, head of human spaceflight with the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said in the RIA Novostia report.
Navias said an agreement had not yet been signed.
“NASA has been exploring the idea of a one-year increment on the space station,” Navias said. “That would be a natural progression as part of preparations for missions beyond low-Earth orbit.” The agency had previously planned missions at no more than six months.
Medical and biological studies are key areas of research aboard the station, a $100 billion, permanently staffed laboratory a partnership of 15 countries, that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.
Doctors are particularly concerned about the effect of long stays in the weightless environment of space has on bone loss, vision changes and impacts to an astronaut’s cardiovascular system.
Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov holds the record for the longest spaceflight, a 438-day mission aboard Russia’s Mir space station in 1994 and 1995.
“Only four people - all Russians - have ever spent a year or more in orbit,” Navias said. “Getting contemporary data with modern equipment would be helpful.”
The longest flight by an American is a 215-day mission by astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria aboard the International Space Station in 2006-2007.
“I think a year is do-able,” Lopez-Alegria told Reuters. “The countermeasures, particularly for bone-density loss, are so much better now.”
Lopez-Alegria said it’s not being in space that takes its toll on the body, it’s coming back.
“You don’t really notice it until you come back and begin recovery. Then you decide whether you’ve pushed it too far or not,” he said.
Yearlong flights also could open seats on Russian Soyuz capsules, now the only vehicles flying people to the space station, for paying tourists or researchers.
The U.S. firm Space Adventures, which has brokered trips to the space station for seven people so far, plans an announcement next week in Russia with opera singer Sarah Brightman, a space enthusiast who already has booked a ride on Virgin Galactic’s planned suborbital SpaceShipTwo vehicle.
The company, an offshoot of Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, is selling tickets for $200,000. Commercial service is expected to begin in late 2013 or 2014.
Since the United States retired its fleet of space shuttles, Soyuz capsules have been fully booked ferrying crews to and from the space station. The last paying passenger to visit the orbital outpost was Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who flew in October 2009. (Editing by Kevin Gray and Philip Barbara)",1
217,https://www.france24.com/en/20181004-iss-astronauts-return-earth-amid-us-russia-tensions,"Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut returned to Earth on Thursday wrapping up a six-month mission at the International Space Station as tensions between Washington and Moscow threaten a rare area of cooperation.
NASA astronauts Drew Feustel and Ricky Arnold and Oleg Artemyev of Roscosmos touched down on steppe land southeast of the Kazakh town of Dzhezkazgan at the expected time of 1145 GMT.
The landing came with Russian and US officials investigating the appearance of a mysterious hole in a Russian space craft docked at the orbiting station.
Detected in August, the hole caused an air leak on the ISS but was quickly sealed up.
This week the outspoken chief of the Russian space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, said investigators believed the small hole had been made deliberately and was not a manufacturing defect.
The official, who was placed under US sanctions over the Ukraine crisis in 2014, also bemoaned ""problems"" in the Russian space agency's cooperation with NASA that he attributed to interference from unnamed American officials.
Last month the Russian daily Kommersant reported that an investigation had probed the possibility that US astronauts deliberately drilled the hole in order to get a sick colleague sent back home -- something Russian officials later denied.
ISS commander Feustel has called the suggestion that the crew was somehow involved ""embarrassing"" and NASA on Wednesday expressed doubts over the theory that the hole was the result of sabotage.
The US space agency said that ruling out defects ""does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent.""
ISS astronauts are planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information on the hole.
The ISS is one of the few areas of tight Russia-US cooperation that had until now remained unaffected by the slump in ties, including after Washington's sanctions against Russia over Ukraine and other crises.
Earlier the ISS hosted the usual emotional goodbyes as the returning trio left Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency, NASA's Serena Auñón-Chancellor and Roscosmos' Sergey Prokopyev waiting for the next three-person crew's arrival.
The next launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is scheduled for next Thursday.
- 'Glory days in hot sun' -
The crew was all smiles on return to Earth, with Artemyev first out of the descent module and shown tucking into a fruit and vegetable feast that included a giant cantaloupe melon in footage broadcast by Roscosmos.
He also wrote ""spasibo"" (thank you) and signed his name on the craft in chalk.
Feustel, 53, invoked Hollywood comedy actor Jack Black's character Nacho Libre as he tweeted farewell to life on the space station.
""I have had my 'glory days in the hot sun' and now it's time to come home,"" he wrote late Wednesday in a tweet that included a photo of the sun taken from the ISS.
While he was on his third mission in space, 47-year-old Artemyev and 54-year-old Arnold had previously only served on one mission each.
Their journey that began with a blastoff from Baikonur in March was particularly poignant for Arnold, who during his debut mission in 2009 helped build the space station he has now spent 197 days living in.
While aboard the ISS, Arnold, who has a teaching background, gave lessons on space that Sharon Christa McAuliffe -- one of seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986 -- had originally been supposed to teach.
In a NASA video, Arnold revealed that fellow educator McAuliffe's death in an explosion just over a minute after the challenger crew blasted off was one of the things that prompted him to take up teaching.
""To me and for our nation it was really important (those lessons) weren't lost,"" he said.

218,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/07/nasa-international-space-station-commercial-access-tourism,"Nasa will allow unprecedented commercial access to the International Space Station (ISS) for marketing, business and space tourism, the agency announced on Friday.
The change paves the way for the wealthy to rocket from Earth and spend time aboard the astronaut home and laboratory in space, through trips planned by private enterprise, and for businesses to develop products or shoot film – including adverts – in space.
The move is part of Nasa’s effort to put the first woman and another man on the moon by 2024. Until now, the space station has only been used for research and development.
“We are so excited to be part of Nasa as our home and laboratory in space transitions into being accessible to expanded commercial and marketing opportunities, as well as to private astronauts,” said astronaut Christina Koch, in a Nasa tweet.
“Enabling a vibrant economy in low-Earth orbit has always been a driving element of the space station program, and will make space more accessible to all Americans,” Koch said. “Transitioning toward this new model of business is an important step to allow Nasa to move full speed ahead in landing the first woman and the next man on the moon.”
The new directive will allow private astronauts to spend up to 30 days in low-Earth orbit aboard the ISS through trips planned by private companies. Nasa said it believes it can accommodate up to two privately funded, short-duration missions a year with, essentially, space tourists.
Private astronauts will have to reimburse the government for the costs to the space station, including $11,250 a day for life support and toilets, and $22,500 a day for food, air and medical supplies. However, astronauts will have to pay a private company to get to the space station, and those tickets will probably cost millions.
Eventually, Nasa hopes the space station will be just one of several “commercial and free-flying habitable destinations in low-Earth orbit”. For now, Nasa is making one space station port available for commercial uses “for a finite period of time”.
The move is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to end government funding for the ISS, and allow commercial enterprise to fund what is now astronauts’ home in space.
“Nasa is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we’ve never done before,” the chief financial officer, Jeff DeWit, said in New York, according to the BBC.
Other details, such as exactly who would be eligible to buy a ticket to the ISS, were not disclosed.
Last year, a committee formed by the Trump administration floated the idea of allowing astronauts to appear in marketing, such as on cereal boxes, for commercials to be filmed in the space station or even for extra-terrestrial rover vehicles to have logos in the way that racing cars do. The committee is headed by an attorney who works in government relations for the space tech firm Maxar Technologies.
“Commercial companies will play an important role both here in low-Earth orbit and around the moon, working with Nasa to test technologies train astronauts and develop a sustainable human presence,” said Koch.
Astronauts have lived aboard the space station for more than 18 years conducting thousands of experiments. The ISS costs Nasa roughly $3bn to $4bn a year to operate, according to the Verge.",1

“It was a spot of bad luck,” he said. “But at the same time I reckoned that as this happened at the start of the mission we have used up our quota of bad luck.”
The rookie astronaut appeared to have a toilet fixation on his debut space mission, as his first tweets during the two-day trip on a Soyuz crew capsule to the ISS was of a picture of the vessel’s rudimentary WC.
He might consider entering the Space Poop Challenge launched last month by Nasa, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Nasa is offering a prize of $30,000 to anyone who before Dec 20 can come up with an idea on what to do with human bodily waste if you have to wear a spacesuit for days on end.",1
220,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-kazakhstan-idUSTRE78F0LW20110916,"ALMATY (Reuters) - A Russian Soyuz space capsule with three astronauts on board landed safely in Kazakhstan on Friday, leaving a single three-man crew aboard the International Space Station.
U.S. astronaut Ron Garan and Russian cosmonauts Andrey Borisenko and Alexander Samokutyaev, who had manned the station since April, appeared in good health after landing on the Kazakh steppe at 0959 local time (0359 GMT).
“We now can confirm that Soyuz TMA-21 has landed,” an announcer on NASA television said. He later described a “bullseye landing.”
The Soyuz capsule landed on its side, whipping up plumes of dust as it settled on the steppe 92 miles southeast of the city of Zhezkazgan.
Samokutyaev was first to emerge, appearing in good spirits as a doctor performed initial medical checks, live pictures broadcast by NASA television showed.
Garan was second to be extracted from the capsule, followed by former station commander Borisenko, who flashed a thumbs-up signal before he and his colleagues were carried on their chairs to a makeshift inflatable hospital for further checks.
Rescue personnel attached a portrait of Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolyov and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, to the capsule. This year marked the 50th anniversary of Gagarin’s first manned space flight.
The returning crew had spent 164 days in space, NASA said. Their replacements -- NASA flight engineer Dan Burbank and cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoly Ivanishin -- were scheduled to arrive on September 24 at the International Space Station, a $100 billion project involving 16 nations.
But their flight was delayed following an August 24 launch accident involving an unmanned Russian cargo ship bound for the station.
The upper-stage motor that failed on the Russian Progress rocket, causing it to burn up in the atmosphere and shower debris across part of Siberia, is virtually identical to one used to fly crew to the station on Soyuz rockets.
The new crew is now scheduled to fly on November 14, NASA said, arriving at the station two days later. In the meantime, one crew -- comprising station commander Mike Fossum, Japanese flight engineer Satoshi Furukawa and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Volkov -- will remain.
They will have little time to prepare the new crew to take over the station before heading home themselves around November 22.
With the retirement of the U.S. space shuttles this summer, crews can reach the station only aboard Russian rockets. China, the only other country able to fly people into orbit, is not a partner in the space station.
The Progress launch failure is believed to have been caused by a blockage in a kerosene fuel line. Russia plans to fly another cargo ship on October 30 before launching the next station crew.

An open letter from the mostly Chinese scientists says using technology to edit human embryo genes was risky and unjustified, and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in the country.
Professor He Jiankui has said he tweaked the DNA of the embryos of twin girls, born a few weeks ago, to prevent them from contracting HIV.
In videos posted online, he defended what he claimed to have achieved, using technology called CRISPR-Cas9.
But the scientists’ letter said: “The biomedical ethics review for this so-called research exists in name only. Conducting direct human experiments can only be described as crazy.
“A Pandora’s box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before it’s too late,” said the letter, written in Chinese and signed by about 120 scientists.
“This is a huge blow to the global reputation and development of Chinese science, especially in the field of biomedical research. It is extremely unfair to most scholars in China who are diligent in research and innovation,” the letter said.
It stated that there was “a huge risk in any attempt to directly perform human embryo transformation and attempting to produce a baby”.
Yang Zhengang, a Fudan University professor, said he signed the letter because gene editing was “very dangerous”.
The Southern University of Science and Technology, where Professor He holds an associate professorship, said it had been unaware of the research project and he had been on leave without pay since February

The university said the experiment was conducted outside its school of biology, and its academic committee believed such work seriously violated academic ethics.
China’s National Health Commission said it was highly concerned and had ordered health officials to investigate.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially “cut and paste” DNA. It has raised hopes of genetic fixes for diseases but there are concerns about its safety and ethics.

222,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11271291/Orion-launch-Nasa-turns-back-clock-with-60s-style-Mars-spacecraft.html,"It is the most advanced spaceship ever made and will eventually carry man to Mars, yet Nasa’s new spacecraft Orion bears an uncanny resemblance to its 50-year-old Apollo forebears.
The craft will make its first unmanned test-flight on Thursday from Kennedy Space Centre, but when astronauts do eventually climb aboard they will blast off in a cone-shaped module which looks almost identical to that used by Neil Armstrong.
The reason for the similarity is simple, says Nasa. Physics has not changed between the middle of the 20th century and now. Apparently, if it ain’t broke, scientists see no need to fix it.
Nasa is hoping to put astronauts back on the Moon by 2020. After that, it is hoped that Orion will journey to Mars in the 2030s.
It is Nasa's first new spacecraft for humans in more than a generation, succeeding the now-retired space shuttles.
""We need a spacecraft that's going to be sturdy enough and robust enough to carry astronauts well beyond low-Earth orbit for weeks and months at a time,” said Lockheed Martin's Bryan Austin, a former Nasa shuttle flight director who will oversee Orion's maiden voyage.
Humans haven’t walked on the surface since 1972. This time however, crew members are hoping to able to establish a lunar base and remain there for up to 180 days at a time.
Technicians and engineers put the finishing touches on the crew module
And nobody will be left behind. The new spaceship allows all four crew members to travel to the surface. In the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Michael Collins was forced to remain on the mothership while Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made history.
However the new astronauts will notice a host of high-tech features on the spacecraft. Where the Apollo command module was peppered with arrays of switches, the new cockpit will feature state-of-the art touchscreen technology which links back to Nasa for instant software downloads.
It is also larger, big enough for four astronauts (or six for shorter missions), and three times more roomy.
Orion command module is 16.5 feet (5m) in diameter and 10.8 feet (3.3m). It will weigh about 31,000 pounds (14,000 kg) empty and have a habitable volume of 692 cubic feet (11 cubic m).
Apollo’s by comparison has a diameter of 12.8 feet (3.9m) and a height of 11.4 feet (3.47m). It weighed around 12,787 pounds (5,800 kg) and its crew cabin volume was 218 cubic feet (6.17 cubic m).
""People often ask us, 'Hey, this thing looks like a capsule, it looks like Apollo,' and people will confuse that with 'it's not new,' "" said Scott Wilson, Nasa's Orion production operations manager.
“While physics drives the capsule's outer bell shape everything else in the capsule is state-of-the-art.
""Everything, from the thrusters, from the environmental control systems, to the structure itself"" is benefiting from all the advances in technology”
A Delta 4 rocket carrying Nasa's first Orion craft on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral
And its journey to the Moon will be different. While Apollo launched on the Saturn V rocket which carried the crew to lunar orbit, Orion’s mission will be in two stages. Firstly it will launch on the Space Launch System (SLS) into Earth’s obit before waiting for four days. A second rocket will launch later which will dock with the Orion capsule and take it to the Moon.
A single site will be selected for touchdown so that later missions can revisit with new materials to build a lunar base.
On Thursday the unmanned capsule will lift off aboard the Delta 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. After than another launch will not happen for four years.
That flight will send the capsule around the moon. Orion's third flight, slated for around 2021, is expected to include astronauts.
""Thursday is a huge day for us,"" said Nasa Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer.
""Part of me hopes that everything is perfect ... but really on a flight test like this ... we want to discover things that are beyond our modelling capability and beyond our expertise so we learn (about) it and fix it.""
And it is carrying a rather strange cargo. Among other items, the module carries the fossilised bone of a T-Rex; a toy figure of Captain Kirk from Star Trek, donated by William Shatner and the oxygen hose from Apollo 11. Nasa is hoping to fire the imaginations of the next generation of astronauts with the stunt.
The dry run, if all goes well, will end with a Pacific splashdown off Mexico's Baja coast. Navy ships will recover the capsule for future use.
One of the primary goals of the 4.5 hour flight is to test how well Orion's heat shield withstands temperatures of about 4,000 Fahrenheit (2,200 Celsius) it will experience during re-entry.",1
223,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/health/china-gene-editing-he-jiankui-intl,"Hong Kong (CNN)China has suspended the research activities of the scientists who claimed to have created the world's first gene-edited babies, state-run Xinhua news reported Thursday.
The moves comes after Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced Monday that two ostensibly healthy twin girls had been born this month from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV.
Chinese authorities called He's claim ""extremely abominable in nature"" and a violation of Chinese law, according to Xinhua.
""The gene-edited twins matter reported by the media has brazenly violated Chinese laws and regulations and breached the science ethics bottom line, which is both shocking and unacceptable,"" said Xu Nanping, vice minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Xinhua reported.
He, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, claims to have used a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR-cas9, which can insert or deactivate certain genes. CRISPR has been hailed as an innovation with tremendous potential, but many in the scientific community believe the technology is still experimental and not ready for human application.
It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.
Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many counties, including the United States. In the United Kingdom, editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval.
China has long been considered on the forefront of gene-editing technology, bankrolling expensive research projects and boasting less regulation in the field than Western nations.
But He's research has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls for a globally binding code of conduct.
He's claims have neither been independently verified nor peer-reviewed. He said his research has been submitted to a scientific journal for review, without naming the publication, and apologized for the result leaking ""unexpectedly.""
On Wednesday, he publicly defended his work at a summit in Hong Kong, saying he was ""proud"" of his achievement. He also raised the possibility of a third child being born, after announcing that a separate woman was pregnant at an early stage with a modified embryo.
But after He's presentation, conference Chairman David Baltimore said the research was not medically necessary, as there are other treatments for HIV. Organizers of the conference called for an independent investigation to ""verify this claim and to ascertain whether the claimed DNA modifications have occurred.""
After He's findings were announced, the Chinese government ordered an ""immediate investigation"" into the incident.",0
224,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/29/work-on-gene-edited-babies-blatant-violation-of-the-law-says-china,"Chinese authorities have declared the work of He Jiankui, a scientist who claims to have created the world’s first gene-edited babies, a violation of Chinese law and called for the suspension of all related activity.
“The genetically edited infant incident reported by media blatantly violated China’s relevant laws and regulations. It has also violated the ethical bottom line that the academic community adheres to. It is shocking and unacceptable,” Xu Nanping, a vice-minister for science and technology, told the state-owned CCTV on Thursday.
Xu called for the suspension of any scientific or technological activities by those involved in He’s work.
The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, where He is an associate professor, has said it had no knowledge of his research.
The scientist has said his project was approved by an ethics committee at Harmonicare Shenzhen women and children’s hospital, which has also denied any involvement.
He shocked the global scientific community when he claimed this week to have edited the genes of embryos that resulted in the birth of twin girls named Lulu and Nana.
However, his work – a byproduct of personal ambition and a vague regulatory environment in a country that has been pushing ahead in the field of gene editing for years – did not come as a total surprise to everyone.
William Hurlbut, a bioethicist at Stanford University who has been in touch with He since an ethics conference last year, said: “I knew that was his long-term goal. I just didn’t think he would push so imprudently. I worried his enthusiasm for what he was doing was so high that he might proceed faster than he should … Now the door is open to this and will never close again. It’s like a hinge of history.”
Born to farmers in Hunan province in 1984, He has been described by his family and friends as fiercely driven and intelligent. In interviews with local media, he has said he would rather spend his holidays in the lab.
“He was always first in primary school, middle school, university and after that. He was never second. Always first,” his father told Beijing News. A former colleague of He’s told local media that the three words that best described the scientist were “smart, crazy and genius”.
“He is China’s Musk,” the colleague said, referring to the Tesla co-founder Elon Musk. Other media reports have called him China’s Einstein.
He, who also goes by his initials JK, depended on government and university scholarships to see him through university in China, where he studied physics. He then earned a PhD in physics at Rice University in the US and conducted post-doctoral research in genome sequencing at Stanford University.
He returned to China in 2012 as part of a talent recruitment programme in the technology hub of Shenzhen and because he wanted to improve Chinese research, which he believed was “weak”, according to his father.
He returned to a country that would soon be at the forefront of gene editing, using technology known as Crispr-Cas9.
China is one of few countries in the world known to have conducted tests on humans with Crispr. Since as early as 2015, cancer patients have been infused with cells of edited DNA. Beijing included gene editing as a key industry in its five-year science and technology development plan for 2016 to 2020.
The UK and many other countries have outlawed the genetic modification of babies, which is considered unsafe and unethical because any modifications would affect the child’s offspring and future generations.
He used the technology to modify the gene CCR5, a doorway for HIV, in several embryos created through IVF for couples with HIV-positive fathers, presenting it as an HIV vaccine trial.
Chinese regulations have not kept pace with scientific breakthroughs in this area. The only relevant regulations come from an “ethics guidance” document released in 2003 that bars the use of any research embryos for reproduction. There are no specified punishments for such violations.
He was able to keep his work from much of the scientific community. He retrospectively registered the clinical trial with Chinese authorities in November, well after the work had been done. A researcher associated with the trial has reportedly said He did not inform all staff involved that his project involved gene editing.
“How can a scientific experiment with so many uncertainties be kept as a secret for such a long time?” asked He Kaiwen, a researcher at Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Biology and Chemistry in Shanghai, who was one of a group of more than 120 scientists who released a statement condemning He’s work. “This shows that there’s huge problem with the transparency of scientific research.”
She added: “This is a completely new situation. This question is one we have never faced before.”
The international scientific community continues to reel from He’s claims, which he defended at a global summit on the topic in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The organising committee of the conference, the International Summit on Human Genome Editing, called the scientist’s statements “unexpected and deeply disturbing” and recommended an independent assessment.
“Even if the modifications are verified, the procedure was irresponsible and failed to conform with international norms. Its flaws include an inadequate medical indication, a poorly designed study protocol, a failure to meet ethical standards for protecting the welfare of research subjects, and a lack of transparency in the development, review, and conduct of the clinical procedures,” the committee said in a statement on Thursday.
Officials from China’s national health commission promised on Thursday to “investigate and deal with any unlawful behaviour” by He.
The government-affiliated China Association for Science and Technology said the incident was “seriously damaging to the image and interests” of the Chinese science community and expressed its “indignation and condemnation of the people and institutions involved”.
Chinese scientists have called for comprehensive regulation to prevent this kind of research in the future. “The improvement of any law comes from exploration,” said He Kaiwen. “Something happens. It reveals a loophole, and we fix it. This is what we scientists want: to push the industry in the right direction.”

225,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/crispr-breakthrough-could-drop-miscarriage-rates/,"Gene-editing technology CRISPR has revealed a clue in how human embryos begin to develop, possibly reducing the risk of miscarriage in those crucial first few weeks of pregnancy.
CRISPR Cas9 can modify or snip out genetic defects thought to contribute to miscarriage, but until now it wasn’t clear why some embryos continued to form into a fetus and others did not. However, findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, hold genetic clues.
British scientists conducting the study found that a certain human genetic marker called OTC4 played an important role in the formation and development in the early stages of embryonic development. The scientists used CRISPR Cas9 to knock out this important gene in days-old human embryos and found that without it, these embryos ceased to attach or grow properly.
The findings could not only help us better understand why some women suffer more miscarriages than others, but it could also potentially greatly increase the rate of successful in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures.
IVF is sometimes the only way a couple can make a baby using their own genes, but even with technological improvements over the years, the rates of success are still poor. Only about 36 percent of IVF cycles result in a viable pregnancy, and a mere 24 percent produce a baby, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Of course, this is not the first time scientists have tested on human embryos. The practice has sparked a fierce international debate, but earlier this year, U.S. scientists used CRISPR technology to cut out a gene known to cause heart defects in three-day old human embryos.
None of the embryos in that study or this latest one were meant to go on to become human beings and were discarded after the study was finished. However, both studies hint at the potential CRISPR could have in the formation of human life in the future.
It will likely take years before putting this breakthrough into practice on viable embryos meant to develop beyond a few days, and there’s likely still much more research needed, but it does give hope for those who’ve suffered a miscarriage and wanting to ensure they can one day carry a healthy baby to full term.",0

Shenzhen Harmonicare Women and Children's Hospital said in a statement that it suspected the signature on a document approving the experiment, specifically its adherence to ethical standards, was falsified.
It has also asked police to investigate.
""We have always firmly opposed the development of genetic experiments that violate human ethics and morality,"" the hospital said on its website.
The experiment, which was led by Chinese professor He Jiankui, altered the DNA of twin girls born a few weeks ago to prevent them from contracting HIV, and has prompted a heated debate among the scientific community.
Some warned that exposing healthy embryos and children to gene editing was irresponsible, while others denounced He's experiment as premature and dangerous.
Chinese scientists and institutions have also criticised the experiment, with 100 scientists in China issuing a joint statement calling for better state legislation.
""It is a great blow to the global reputation and development of biomedical research in China,"" said the statement posted on the Twitter-like platform Weibo.
The university where He works has also distanced itself from the scientist's experiment.
""This research work was carried out by Professor He Jiankui outside of the school,"" the Southern University of Science and Technology said in a statement Monday.
He has been on unpaid leave since February and his research is a ""serious violation of academic ethics and norms"", it said.
The Shenzhen Harmonicare Women and Children's Hospital too has denied any involvement with He.

227,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/08/nasa-invites-tourists-spend-month-international-space-station/,"Nasa is opening up the International Space Station to tourists, who will be able to pay nearly $60 million (£47.1m) for month-long holidays in orbit starting from next year.
The space agency also announced private companies would be allowed to use the orbiting platform for business ventures including filming TV advertisements, and using Nasa astronauts to market their products.
It is part of Nasa's attempt to recoup some of the $100 billion cost of the space station as the agency begins to focus on the expensive project of returning astronauts to the moon.
Nasa will charge tourists tens of thousands of dollars per night for lodging, food, water, and use of life support systems on the space station.
Jim DeWit, the agency's chief financial officer, said: ""If you look at the pricing and you add it up, back of a napkin, it would be roughly $35,000 a night, per astronaut. But it won’t come with any Hilton or Marriott points.""
The bulk of the bill for would-be space tourists will be an estimated $58 million for a round-ticket seat on a space taxi.
That money will go to either SpaceX or Boeing, both of which are developing vehicles to make the trip.
Private astronauts will travel on SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, or Boeing's Starliner.
Nasa said there would be up to two such trips a year, and stays would be for a maximum of 30 days.
A total of up to a dozen private astronauts could go per year, and would be selected by the private tour operators.
The space agency made its announcement at the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York, where it announced it was ""opening the space station for commercial business"" and hoped to attract customers.
It said the aim was to ""accelerate a thriving commercial economy in low-Earth orbit"" and to ""strengthen the burgeoning space economy.""
Nasa said it will also allow ""marketing, and promoting, commercial products and services,"" raising the possibility that trips could be used by private companies for advertising purposes.
Advertisers will be charged for using the space station to promote ""products intended for commercial sale on Earth,"" Nasa said.
They will be able to buy 90 hours of ""crew time"" per year, meaning Nasa astronauts could be used to advertise products. The products would have to weigh less than 175kg.
A Nasa spokesman said: ""Nasa astronauts will be able to conduct coordinated, scheduled and reimbursable commercial and marketing activities consistent with government ethics requirements aboard the station.""
Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator at Nasa, said it was unknown what the end result of the new ""open for business"" policy would be.
He said: ""We have no idea what kinds of creativity, and literally out of the world ideas, can come from private industry.""
Nasa has previously talked to private companies about taking over the entire operation of the costly space station, but none have wanted to.
It will not be the first time a space tourist has been to the station. Roscosmos, Nasa's Russian counterpart, has previously taken privately funded astronauts there. In 2001 Dennis Tito, an American businessman, paid around $20 million to go to the space station on a Russian rocket.",1
228,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/12/03/nasa-gets-new-countdown-clock-just-in-time-for-orion-launch-debut-test-flight.html,"NASA gets new countdown clock just in time for Orion's launch debut; test flight Thursday
NASA has a new state-of-the-art space capsule on the launch pad and a new high-tech countdown clock to go with it.
The multimedia display was lit up Tuesday and counting down the hours, minutes and seconds until Thursday morning's liftoff of Orion on an unmanned orbital test flight. It's the nation's first new spacecraft intended for true outer-space travel by humans since the Apollo moon program.
What better way to usher in this new era of exploration, NASA reasoned, than with the latest flat-screen gizmo.
So last week, down came the countdown clock that dated back to the Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch for 30 years. And up went the new display in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation.
The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet.
NASA spokesman George Diller said the old clock, while still working, had become too expensive to fix and maintain. Parts were hard to come by. (It used 349 light bulbs to illuminate the hours, minutes and seconds, the colons and the plus and minus signs.)
""It was just becoming an antique,"" Diller said.
The new $280,000 display, similar to those used at sports stadiums, can provide multiple images in addition to the countdown time. ""An electronic billboard,"" explained Mike Bolger, a NASA ground systems manager.
On Tuesday, the countdown numbers ticked down in the lower right corner — far smaller than on the old familiar clock. But that's because the left half of the display showed a real-time, close-up image of the Delta IV rocket launch pad. In the upper right corner, the words ""Orion Test Flight"" showed in red, sandwiched between an Orion emblem and the NASA logo.
NASA took pains to keep the scene basically the same, with the clock and flag pole, according to Diller. Even so, more than a few space-age veterans were sorry to see the old, familiar clock hauled off. Diller tried to be philosophical about the switch: ""We won't have to worry about changing the light bulbs anymore.""
Apollo 17's launch on Dec. 7, 1972, marked mankind's last trip to the moon — and the last crewed capsule to leave Earth's immediate vicinity.
This inaugural Orion — scheduled for a 7:05 a.m. EST send-off — will carry no crew during the 4½-hour test flight and be confined to Earth orbit. But it will aim for a high point of 3,600 miles on the second loop of the planet, setting the spacecraft up for a 20,000-mph, 4,000-degree re-entry. Splashdown will occur in the Pacific, 600 miles southwest of San Diego.
For this launch, a Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting.
Future Orions will be launched aboard NASA's still-in-development Space Launch System, or SLS, intended to carry astronauts to asteroids, Mars and beyond.
One plan calls for an asteroid to be corralled in orbit around the moon, so an Orion crew can explore the rock sometime in the 2020s. Mars expeditions would follow in the 2030s.
NASA is counting on the new countdown clock to be around for all that.
Traditionalists, meanwhile, can take heart.
The space center hopes to reassemble and display the old clock at its tourist stop next year.",1

An unmanned version of an Orion capsule, built by Lockheed Martin for NASA, will lift off aboard a Delta 4 Heavy rocket at 7:05 a.m. EST/1205 GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, officials said on Tuesday.
Thursday’s test run will be followed in four years with the launch of a second Orion capsule, also unmanned, on the debut flight of NASA’s still-under-development Space Launch System rocket. That flight will send the capsule around the moon. Orion’s third flight, slated for around 2021, is expected to include astronauts.
Eventually, NASA intends to use Orion and the SLS rocket to send crews to Mars, the ultimate goal of the U.S. human space program. Astronauts have not ventured beyond Earth’s orbit since the 1969-1972 Apollo moon program.
“Thursday is a huge day for us,” NASA Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer told reporters. “Part of me hopes that everything is perfect ... but really on a flight test like this ... we want to discover things that are beyond our modeling capability and beyond our expertise so we learn (about) it and fix it.”
The rocket, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, will catapult the capsule as far as 3,600 miles (5,800 km) from Earth so it can slam back into the atmosphere at a speed of 20,000 miles per hour (32,200 km per hour).
One of the primary goals of the 4-1/2-hour flight is to test how well Orion’s heat shield withstands temperatures of about 4,000 Fahrenheit (2,200 Celsius) it will experience during re-entry.
Another key test comes when the capsule’s 11 parachutes deploy to slow its descent to 20 mph (32 kph) so it can gently splash down in the Pacific Ocean for recovery.
NASA wants to reuse the capsule to test an emergency escape system needed in case of an accident during liftoff. Engineers also are eager to retrieve data collected by sensors aboard Orion that will record conditions experienced during Thursday’s flight.

The first-ever year-long mission to the International Space Station will launch in 2015 and feature an American-Russian crew, NASA revealed today (Oct. 5).
Two astronauts — one Russian and one American — will launch together in spring 2015 on an experimental endurance mission that will last twice as long as current stays aboard the orbiting lab. The main goal is to gather data that will help lay the groundwork for manned flights to destinations in deep space, officials said.
""In order for us to eventually move beyond low-Earth orbit, we need to better understand how humans adapt to long-term spaceflight,"" NASA's Michael Suffredini, International Space Station program manager, said in a statement. ""The space station serves as a vital scientific resource for teaching us those lessons, and this year-long expedition aboard the complex will help us move closer to those journeys.""
The announcement confirms speculation that has been bubbling for several months. Earlier this week, a Russian space official claimed the marathon mission was a done deal, but until today NASA had simply said that such a flight was under consideration. [Most Extreme Human Spaceflight Records]
Launching two astronauts means that one seat on the mission's three-person Soyuz spacecraft may be available for another crewmember. On Oct. 10, British singer Sarah Brightman will make a ""groundbreaking announcement"" about space travel, and some observers speculate that she — or somebody else — may be taking the Soyuz' third seat as a space tourist.
During the 12 years that people have lived continuously aboard the space station, scientists have learned a lot about how microgravity affects the human body. They've documented significant effects, for example, on bone density, muscle mass, strength and vision.
But that information has been based on orbital stays that lasted a maximum of six months. Studying astronauts on a year-long mission should yield even greater insights into crew health and performance, researchers said.
""We have gained new knowledge about the effects of spaceflight on the human body from the scientific research conducted on the space station, and it is the perfect time to test a one-year expedition aboard the orbital laboratory,"" said Julie Robinson, NASA's program scientist for the International Space Station. ""What we will gain from this expedition will influence the way we structure our human research plans in the future.""
NASA has a keen interest in learning how the human body holds up for long stretches in space, for the agency is currently working to send astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025 and Mars by the mid-2030s. A manned roundtrip journey to Mars could take around two years, according to some mission concepts.
Neither NASA nor the Russian Federal Space Agency, which is known as Roscosmos, has revealed who the two astronauts will be. A few months ago, however, Russia's Interfax news agency reported that the NASA crewmember could be Peggy Whitson, who recently stepped down as the agency's chief astronaut to rejoin its active spaceflying ranks.
While no astronaut has yet stayed aboard the International Space Station for 12 continuous months, such a long stay in orbit is not unprecedented. Cosmonaut Valery Polyakov lived aboard Russia's Mir space station from January 1994 until March 1995, spending 438 consecutive days off the planet.",1

Nasa announces most staff will be working from home for foreseeable future
The International Space Station is the safest place to be during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a researcher.
Luis Zea, a researcher from BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Newsweek the checks they enforce prevent any outbreak from taking place.
“Prior to launching to the International Space Station, the crew is quarantined and observed for any potential symptoms and tested,” said Mr Zea. “This serves as a great filter.”
Mr Zea added that amid the pandemic “the ISS is probably one of the safest places to be.”
The researcher explained that coronavirus can only survive for short periods on surfaces and “an infected person would likely be screened and diagnosed during the quarantine period astronauts go through prior to launch.”
Last week a SpaceX rocket sent a “mobile mini-laboratory” up to the International Space Station.
The scientists will grow the beginnings of new organs and watch how the stem cells develop as part of the project.
On Tuesday, the agency published a press release from Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, confirming staff will be working from home while thanking them for their help.
“Nasa’s early and thoughtful actions in coordination with our country’s unified response to this health emergency is an incredible display of national solidarity,” said Mr Bridenstine.
“Thank you for your vigilance and flexibility. I am confident your diligence and commitment will ensure our mission will continue. Please make certain you are giving the appropriate attention to your health and that of your family.”
Some 5,000 cases of the disease have been recorded so far in the US, and 94 deaths.

Gene-editing breakthrough could ‘transform understanding of human biology’, say scientists
Controversial research on early human embryos 'cements the UK’s position as a global leader for scientifically and ethically rigorous laboratory studies using genome editing to understand early human development', says Medical Research Council
Doing so appeared to prevent the five-day-old embryo from forming the structure that later creates the placenta, suggesting the gene plays a key role in that process.
The scientists, led by Dr Kathy Niakan of the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the technique could now be used to find out a whole host of genetic factors that affect pregnancy, which are at present poorly understood.
This could revolutionise IVF, helping couples with fertility problems have children, but also lead to advances in regenerative medicine. This involves using stem cells, which can form any kind of tissue, to replace missing structures in the body or repair damage.
Commenting on the breakthrough, the Medical Research Council’s chief science officer said it cemented Britain’s position as “a global leader for scientifically and ethically rigorous laboratory studies using genome editing to understand early human development”.
Dr Niakan said: “One way to find out what a gene does in the developing embryo is to see what happens when it isn’t working.
“Now we have demonstrated an efficient way of doing this, we hope that other scientists will use it to find out the roles of other genes.
“If we knew the key genes that embryos need to develop successfully, we could improve IVF treatments and understand some causes of pregnancy failure.”
However she added that the study was “just the first step” and cautioned it “may take many years to achieve such an understanding”.
In the Nature paper, the researchers said that despite their “fundamental biological and clinical importance”, the processes that govern the first “cell fate decisions” of a human embryo were “not well understood”.
To help address this, they used the Crispr-Cas9 genome editing technique to investigate the effect of a gene known as POU5FI, which affects a developmental regulator called OCT4.
While finding out the gene’s role in the creation of the blastocyst, an early embryo structure which later helps create the placenta, is itself an advance in our understanding of the creation of human life, the scientists also wanted to find out if it was actually possible to edit the genome of an embryo.
“We conclude that Crispr-Cas9-mediated genome editing is a powerful method for investigating gene function in the context of human development,” they wrote.
“This proof of principle lays out a framework for future investigations that could transform our understanding of human biology, thereby leading to improvements in the establishment and therapeutic use of stem cells and in IVF treatments.”
Another member of the team, Dr Norah Fogarty, also of the Crick institute, cautioned that further research was needed.
“We were surprised to see just how crucial this gene is for human embryo development, but we need to continue our work to confirm its role,” she said.
“Other research methods, including studies in mice, suggested a later and more focused role for OCT4, so our results highlight the need for human embryo research.”

Sir Paul Nurse, the former president of the Royal Society and now director of the Francis Crick Institute, described the research as “exciting and important”.
“The study has been carried out with full regulatory oversight and offers new knowledge of the biological processes at work in the first five or six days of a human embryo’s healthy development,” he said.
“Kathy Niakan and colleagues are providing new understanding of the genes responsible for a crucial change when groups of cells in the very early embryo first become organised and set on different paths of development.
“The processes at work in these embryonic cells will be of interest in many areas of stem cell biology and medicine.""
Other scientists also praised the study as a significant step for science.
Dr Rob Buckle, chief science officer at the Medical Research Council, said: “This ground-breaking research cements the UK’s position as a global leader for scientifically and ethically rigorous laboratory studies using genome editing to understand early human development.
“Genome editing technologies – particularly Crispr-Cas9 used in this study – are having a game-changing effect on our ability to understand the function of critical human genes.
“While the science is at a relatively early stage, these findings pave the way for uncovering the function of genes critical to human development and health, and importantly can tease-out critical differences to knowledge gained through working with animal models.”

Apparently referencing the concerns held by some about gene-editing of humans – such as the suggestion scientists could create ‘designer babies’ – Dr Buckle said it was “vital that this work continues within a robust yet adaptable regulatory framework so that its full potential can be realised in a scientific, ethical and legally rigorous way”.
Dr Dusko Ilic, an expert in stem cell science at King’s College London, pointed out how important such research was for many prospective parents and added that it had also revealed the limitations of research on animals.
“One in every four couples has been affected by infertility and to address the issue, we have to understand the biology of the earliest stages of human development,” he said.
“To do that, we cannot rely only on animal, mostly mouse, models. In this proof-of-concept study, using genome editing Crispr/Cas9 technology, the scientists have demonstrated that a gene POUF51 plays somewhat different roles in human than in mouse preimplantation embryos.
“This is in a way unexpected, because of the dogma that the earliest stages of development are common for all mammalian and even some non-mammalian species. The study is another proof that the findings from experimental animal models cannot be always extrapolated to humans.”

233,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-babies/chinese-scientist-who-made-gene-edited-babies-evaded-oversight-to-seek-fame-report-idUSKCN1PF0RA?feedType=RSS&feedName;=worldNews,"SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist who created what he said were the world’s first “gene-edited” babies evaded oversight and broke ethical boundaries in a quest for fame and fortune, state media said on Monday, as his former university said he had been fired.
He Jiankui said in November that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born that month, sparking an international outcry about the ethics and safety of such research.
Hundreds of Chinese and international scientists condemned He and said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was unethical.
Chinese authorities also denounced He and issued a temporary halt to research activities involving the editing of human genes.
He had “deliberately evaded oversight” with the intent of creating a gene-edited baby “for the purpose of reproduction”, according to the initial findings of an investigating team set up by the Health Commission of China in southern Guangdong province, Xinhua news agency reported.
He had raised funds himself and privately organized a team of people to carry out the procedure in order to “seek personal fame and profit”, Xinhua said, adding that he had forged ethical review papers in order to enlist volunteers for the procedure.
The safety and efficacy of the technologies He used are unreliable and creating gene-edited babies for reproduction is banned by national decree, the report said.
The Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in the city of Shenzhen, said in a statement on its website that He had been fired.
“Effective immediately, SUSTech will rescind the work contract with Dr. Jiankui He and terminate any of his teaching and research activities at SUSTech,” the statement said.
The university added the decision came after a preliminary investigation by the Guangdong Province Investigation Task Force.
Neither He nor a representative could be reached for comment on Monday. He defended his actions at a conference in Hong Kong in November, saying that he was “proud” of what he had done and that gene editing would help protect the girls from being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
International experts in genetic science said they hoped that Monday’s report was only the initial result of investigations into He and that more action would be taken.
“The report will hopefully set an example with appropriate legal and punitive actions to reassure the public and scientific community,” said Yalda Jamshidi, a genomics expert at Britain’s University of London.
He’s announcement sparked a debate among Chinese legal scholars over which laws He had technically broken by carrying out the procedure, as well as whether he could be held criminally responsible or not.
Many scholars pointed to a 2003 guideline that bans altered human embryos from being implanted for the purpose of reproduction, and says altered embryos cannot be developed for more than 14 days.
The case files of those involved who are suspected of committing crimes have been sent to the ministry of public security, an unnamed spokesperson for the investigation team was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
Helen O’Neill, a reproductive science expert at University College London, said she was concerned that the report gave “no further clarification on what measures will be taken to prevent this happening in future, nor what will be done as punishment”.

234,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/asia/gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html,"Chinese Scientist Who Says He Edited Babies’ Genes Defends His Work
A Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies said at a conference on Wednesday that his actions were safe and ethical, and he asserted that he was proud of what he had done. But many other scientists seemed highly skeptical, with a conference organizer calling his actions irresponsible.
“For this specific case, I feel proud, actually,” the scientist, He Jiankui, said at an international conference on genome editing in Hong Kong.
Indeed, the only thing Dr. He apologized for was that news had “leaked unexpectedly” that he had used the gene-editing technique Crispr to alter embryos and then implanted them in the womb of a woman who gave birth to twin girls this month.
Dr. He’s announcement of his embryo editing on Monday sent a thunderbolt through the scientific world. Scientists have been working assiduously to prevent just such a rogue use of the rapidly advancing technology for making changes in human DNA.
Scores of scientists — including many of the top-flight genetics experts gathered in Hong Kong for what they had expected to be a much less newsworthy conference — have called Dr. He’s conduct unethical. They say there are serious unanswered questions about the safety of embryo editing and a need to make sure that such research is conducted in a transparent, monitored way so the technology isn’t misused.
And Dr. He’s presentation Wednesday afternoon did not seem to mollify many of his colleagues’ concerns.
Immediately after his presentation, David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate who led the conference’s organizing committee, told the audience that what Dr. He had done “would still be considered irresponsible.”
Dr. Baltimore added, “I don’t think it has been a transparent process. We only found out about it after it happened, and after the children were even born. I personally don’t think it was medically necessary.”
Robin Lovell-Badge, a professor of genetics and embryology at the Francis Crick Institute in London who moderated the session, asked a question that he said was on many attendees’ minds.
“Why so much secrecy around this, particularly when you know the general feeling around the scientific community is we shouldn’t go ahead yet?” Dr. Lovell-Badge asked. “You know the accusation now is that you’ve broken the law. If you had involved the Chinese authorities, they might have said you can’t do it.”
After Dr. He’s presentation, the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins, issued a scathing denunciation, calling it “a deeply disturbing willingness by Dr. He and his team to flaunt international ethical norms.”
“It is profoundly unfortunate that the first apparent application of this powerful technique to the human germline has been carried out so irresponsibly,” Dr. Collins said, calling for international consensus on setting limits for such research. “Without such limits, the world will face the serious risk of a deluge of similarly ill-considered and unethical projects. Should such epic scientific misadventures proceed, a technology with enormous promise for prevention and treatment of disease will be overshadowed by justifiable public outrage, fear, and disgust.”
When Dr. He, 34, walked onstage in an open-collar shirt carrying a tan briefcase, it was clear this would be no ordinary conference presentation. Although his appearance had been previously scheduled, Dr. Lovell-Badge said Dr. He had earlier “sent me the slides he was going to show in this presentation and it didn’t include anything that he is going to talk about today.”
Facing a packed auditorium of scientists and members of the media, Dr. He also acknowledged that he had not made his university in China aware of the research he was doing.
But he asserted that he had not been overly secretive about his work, saying that he had presented preliminary aspects of it at conferences and consulted with scientists in the United States and elsewhere. He said he had submitted his research to a scientific journal for review and had not expected to be presenting it at this conference.
And he insisted that the parents of the twins and seven other couples who had participated in his research were fully informed of the risks involved, and that they understood what was being done to their embryos.
“The parents were informed of the implication of this,” Dr. He said. “We reminded them of the option to leave the trial without implantation, or to choose the embryos. The couple elected to implant these embryos to start a two-embryo pregnancy.”
Showing a series of slides, he quickly described what he said was three years of work involving mice, monkeys and then human embryos. He used the editing technique, Crispr-Cas9, to disable a gene, called CCR₅, which creates a protein that makes it possible for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, to infect people’s cells.
Dr. He said that with the help of an H.I.V./AIDS organization in China, he recruited eight couples in which the man had H.I.V. and the woman did not. One couple dropped out and another achieved a “chemical pregnancy,” a pregnancy which fails soon after the embryo is implanted in the womb.
After editing the CCR₅ genes, he said he used in vitro fertilization to create embryos that were resistant to H.I.V. The goal, he said, was to engineer babies who would not be vulnerable to H.I.V. infection.
Many scientists have noted that there are other, simpler ways to protect newborn babies of an infected parent, especially an infected father, from getting H.I.V. Embryo editing should be used only to prevent or treat dire medical conditions that cannot be addressed in any other way, they said.
But Dr. He suggested that the parents of the twins, especially the H.I.V.-positive father, saw the procedure as a way to recapture their reason for living.
“I feel proudest, because they had lost hope for life,” Dr. He said. “But with this protection, he sent a message saying he will work hard, earn money, and take care of his two daughters and his wife for this life.”
Scientists also objected to indications that Dr. He had not fully informed his colleagues, his university or the parents about what exactly he was doing. For example, while the consent form he gave to potential parents mentioned gene editing in the text, it initially describes the research as an “AIDS vaccine development project.”
Dr. He appears not to have sought approval from Chinese regulators, and he waited months to list his research in a Chinese clinical trial registry, not doing so until early November.
“Science is open, science is collaborative and communicative,” Feng Zhang, one of the inventors of the Crispr-Cas9 system and a core member of the MIT Broad Institute, said after Dr. He’s presentation. “What he has done was not transparent. It was against the community’s consent and it does not represent science.”
In addition, The Associated Press reported that Dr. He’s lab allowed some of the medical staff assisting with the project to believe that they were involved in conventional IVF efforts that also included mapping genomes — nothing that involved editing embryos.
While Dr. He said the twins were “born normally and healthy,” other scientists questioned how healthy they would turn out to be. Dr. He said that in one of the twins, both copies of the CCR₅ gene were disabled, but that in the other twin, only one copy was.
That suggests that the twin with one disabled copy is still vulnerable to H.I.V. infection, scientists said. And Maria Jasin, a developmental biologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, pointed out to Dr. He that family dynamics could be affected “with the two girls being different, and this being something of an enhancement, not a disease correction.”
Dr. He said the parents were fully informed and that they decided to implant both embryos. He said the mother declined to have amniocentesis to check for genetic abnormalities during the pregnancy.
He said he planned to “monitor the twins’ health for the next 18 years, with the hope they will consent as adults for continued monitoring and support.” He referred to the girls by the names Lulu and Nana.
Dr. He said he initially paid for the research himself, then later from his university funding. He said he covered his patients’ medical expenses personally, and that neither of the two genomics companies he founded had paid for anything.
The birth of gene-edited children is alarming for both practical and theoretical reasons. First and foremost are safety concerns.
Most earlier efforts to edit embryos in a laboratory dish have resulted in some unintended effects, like off-target mutations that can occur in other genes, or mosaicism, in which the altered gene appears in some cells but not others. Scientists do not know the consequences of such effects.
Dr. He said he worked to minimize off-target effects and ultimately did not detect any after birth. He said he would continue to do blood tests and analyze for mosaicism or off-target mutations.
Another concern is that while editing of genes in most human cells to, for example, fix a disease-causing mutation affects only the person whose genes are edited, embryo editing — also called germline engineering — makes changes that are passed on to subsequent generations.
Then there is the concern that editing could be used to create babies with superior skills or desired physical features, changes that are not in the same league of importance as curing devastating genetic diseases and could have unpredictable social effects if such techniques became common.
Several countries, including the United States, have made it illegal to deliberately alter human embryos. It is not against the law in China, but is opposed by many researchers and institutions there.
Xu Nanping, China’s vice-minister of science and technology, said Tuesday that the Chinese government had issued regulations in 2003 that permitted gene-editing experiments on embryos for research purposes, but only if they remain viable no more than 14 days, according to the state broadcaster China Central Television. If the Chinese authorities confirm that the babies were born, that would be in violation of current regulations, Mr. Xu said.
As recently as last year, Dr. He wrote in a blog post that Crispr was a new technology that required “more in-depth research and understanding.” Performing gene-editing on humans without addressing the safety risks “is extremely irresponsible, both from the point of view of science and social ethics,” he wrote.
Dr. He was scheduled to speak at a second session on Thursday at the conference in Hong Kong, but after his presentation on Wednesday, the Thursday appearance was canceled. His topic at that session had been entitled: “The Roadmap towards Developing Standards for Safety and Efficacy for Human Germline Gene Editing and Moral Principles.”",0

236,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/opinion/china-crispr-babies.html,"Before the Claims of Crispr Babies, There Was China’s One-Child Policy
The Chinese government has a long history of using technology to control and manipulate reproduction.
Ms. Fong is the author of a book about China’s one-child policy.
When I first read about the discovery of Crispr — a cheap, easily deployed tool to modify DNA sequences — I had a hunch. Although I am neither a scientist nor a clairvoyant, I thought it highly likely that the first Crispr baby would be Chinese.
So it was with a sense of inevitability that I read this week’s claims by He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist based in Shenzhen, to have engineered the world’s first Crispr babies — twins.
China excels in most kinds of technology, but when it comes to gene editing and designer babies, it has an extra advantage: a population that has been conditioned to manipulating reproduction as a tool for progress. I’m referring, of course, to the three decades of family-planning rules known as the one-child policy.
Behind the science of what’s doable is the mind-set of what’s desirable. China’s unprecedented reproductive experiment, officially ended in 2015 although many restrictions continue, has created a people accustomed — in many cases, forcibly so — to controlling the number and gender of their offspring. The one-child policy was established ostensibly to curb population growth, but China’s leaders were not shy about exhorting the country’s people to reduce quantity to improve quality, shading the policy with eugenic undertones.
This became explicit with the 1994 Eugenics and Health Protection Law forbidding people with mental or physical disorders from reproducing. (Global outrage led Beijing to rename it the National Maternal and Infant Health Law.) Under the one-child policy, sex-selective abortions, which favored males in China’s patriarchal tradition, became so prevalent that the country now has about 30 million surplus bachelors — roughly the population of Canada.
From all this to “designer babies” is not so great a leap. An openness to gene editing’s worst excesses may prove to be the one-child policy’s most unfortunate legacy.
Dr. He, who was born in 1984, was raised while the one-child policy was in effect. He was clearly concerned about its uses, claiming in a YouTube video that he felt compelled to edit the genes of the twins, Lulu and Nana, for resistance to H.I.V. because H.I.V. sufferers faced forced sterilization, among other problems. “There will be someone, somewhere, who is doing this,” he said in an interview on Tuesday with The Associated Press. “If it’s not me, it’s someone else.”
China has already run Crispr experiments on adults such as cancer patients, but making Crispr babies crosses an ethical line by creating traits that can be handed down, potentially shaping the entire gene pool. Medical ethicists have already warned that this puts the human race on the slippery slope to a “Gattaca”-like existence, in which biology is destiny.
In China, many people have already ventured into that terrain. Even before Crispr, it has been possible to create so-called designer babies using in vitro fertilization and selecting egg donors with desirable genetic enhancements, such as looks and intelligence. That’s what many wealthy Chinese have been doing for years. The practice is fairly standard among rich consumers of any nationality, but I was told by fertility clinics and doctors in California that Chinese customers were frequently the most upfront and demanding, driving up prices of East Asian donor eggs to twice and even triple market rates.
Wendie Wilson-Miller, who runs an egg donor agency in Southern California, told me that her Chinese clients “almost always want taller, at least 5 foot 5. And they have questions about eyelids; they want to see baby pictures to see if the donor’s had eyelid surgery.”
For years, B.G.I. Shenzhen, one of the world’s largest gene-sequencing facilities, has been running a project to explore the genetic basis for human intelligence, with the goal of eventually enabling parents to boost their offspring’s I.Q. before birth. While it may not be possible to isolate human intelligence to a purely genetic component, the company clearly believes there’s huge potential demand for such a service. One of its co-founders, Wang Jiang, recently caused a furor when he said in a speech that employees would not be allowed to have children with birth defects because they would “be a disgrace.”
No society is uniform, and news of the Crispr babies has generated much condemnation and outrage within China, particularly by Dr. He’s peers, who consider him an irresponsible rogue scientist. A top Chinese bioethicist, Qiu Renzong, compared his actions to “using a cannon to shoot a bird.”
But at the same time, a recent poll indicated wide support in China for gene editing to treat disease, with 24 percent in favor of legalizing gene editing for enhancing intelligence. By contrast, 68 percent of Americans say they are worried about gene editing and its effects, according to Pew Research.
Much is still unknown about the so-called Crispr babies. But it is almost certain that more will follow; Dr. He has already said his experiments have generated another pregnancy. It is also almost certain someone will attempt gene editing to make stronger, smarter, more attractive babies. Pandora’s box is wide open in China.

237,https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042530/china-gene-editing-scientist-he-jiankuiprison-fine-sentenced-designer-babies-lulu-nana,"A Chinese court has sentenced the scientist behind the world’s first gene-edited babies, He Jiankui, to three years in prison, saying that the researcher’s team “crossed the bottom line of ethics.” Alongside his prison sentence, The Guardian reports that He was also fined 3 million yuan (around $430,000).
He Jiankui was sentenced alongside two colleagues. Zhang Renli was fined 1 million yuan (around $143,000) and sentenced to two years in prison, while Qin Jinzhou was fined 500,000 yuan (around $71,000) and sentenced to 18-months in prison, with a two-year reprieve.
“The three accused did not have the proper certification to practice medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment,” the court said in comments that were reported by state news agency Xinhua.
He Jiankui claimed to have helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls Lula and Nana — back in November 2018 using the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9. This kind of work is banned in the US and other countries due to the ethical concerns of manipulating human embryos, as well as the risk the work poses to other genes, where it can create unintended side-effects that could be passed on to future generations. The scientific community was fiercely critical of the work, and He was subsequently fired from his university position at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen.
Beyond the ethical implications, analysis of He’s work suggests that his efforts may have actually put their health at risk. The experiment aimed to make the babies immune to HIV by altering the CCR5 gene, which is believed to affect resistance to HIV. Although everyone has two copies of each gene (one from each parent), researchers pointed out that He only edited one copy of the gene. One geneticist said there are “all kinds of glitches” with the way the work was carried out, and another said that the babies probably aren’t HIV-resistant as a result.
“The claim they have reproduced the prevalent CCR5 variant is a blatant misrepresentation of the actual data and can only be described by one term: a deliberate falsehood,” Fyodor Urnov, a genome-editing scientist and the University of California, told MIT Technology Review in response to the research.",0

239,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-genome-editing-idUSKBN15T24P?feedType=RSS&feedName=scienceNews,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Powerful gene editing tools may one day be used on human embryos, eggs and sperm to remove genes that cause inherited diseases, according to a report by U.S. scientists and ethicists released on Tuesday.
The report from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Academy of Medicine said scientific advances make gene editing in human reproductive cells “a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.”
The statement signals a softening in approach over the use of the technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.
In December 2015, scientists and ethicists at an international meeting held at the NAS in Washington said it would be “irresponsible” to use gene editing technology in human embryos for therapeutic purposes, such as to correct genetic diseases, until safety and efficacy issues are resolved.
Though the technology is still not ready, the latest NAS report says clinical trials for genome editing of the human germline could be permitted, “but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.”
Such editing is not legal in the United States, and other countries have signed a convention prohibiting the practice on concerns it could be used to create so-called designer babies.
CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.
Genome editing is already being planned for use in clinical trials of people to correct diseases caused by a single gene mutation, such as sickle cell disease. But these therapies affect only the patient.
The concern is over use of the technology in human reproductive cells or early embryos because the changes would be passed along to offspring.
Research using the powerful technique is plowing ahead even as researchers from the University of California and the Broad Institute battle for control over the CRISPR patent.
Although gene editing of human reproductive cells to correct inherited diseases “must be approached with caution, caution does not mean prohibition,” the committee said in a statement.
Sarah Norcross of the Progress Educational Trust, which advocates for people affected by genetic conditions, called the recommendations “sensible and prudent.”
But Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society said they were “unsettling and disappointing,” arguing that they “constitute a green light for proceeding with efforts to modify the human germline” - changes that can be passed to future generations.

American astronaut Dr Kjell Lindgren harvested the leaves using tongs and placed them on a tray before tucking in. Afterwards, he said: ""That's awesome.""
Fellow astronaut Scott Kelly spread olive oil and balsamic vinegar on his. He said: ""Tastes good. Kind of like arugula. It was one small bite for man...""
They and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui saved some lettuce leaves for Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, who were outside on a spacewalk.
Dr Ray Wheeler, a Nasa scientist working on the project, said: ""There is evidence that supports the idea that fresh foods such as tomatoes, blueberries and red lettuce are a good source of antioxidants.
""Having fresh food like these available in space could have a positive impact on people's moods and also could provide some protection against radiation in space.""
For the first attempt at space farming scientists chose a hardy variety of red romaine lettuce as the crop.
It was tended by Kelly, who is spending a year on the space station while his twin brother remains on Earth.
That is helping scientists to evaluate the impact a long mission to Mars would have on the human body.
The lettuce seeds were embedded in rooting pillows which contained soil and fertiliser.
Water cannot be poured in space so moisture was delivered using a special irrigation system underneath the soil.
The seeds were flown to the space station in April 2014 by SpaceX, the private company run by billionaire Elon Musk, which has been contracted by Nasa to make cargo runs.
An initial crop was grown last year but not eaten by astronauts, instead being brought back to Earth and tested to check it was safe.
Kelly then grew the second batch under red, blue, and green lights.
Nasa said the green lights were particularly important in making the lettuce ""look like edible food rather than weird purple plants"".
Before eating the astronauts took the safety precaution of wiping the lettuce leaves with citric acid-based sanitising wipes.
In the past they have had to wait for shipments of fresh vegetables and eat them quickly before they went off.
Nasa, which is aiming to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, said there could also be psychological benefits associated with ""space gardening"" and it may become a feature of life on the space station, and Mars.
Tending to vegetables would provide those on the first mission with a distraction, and help them to maintain their sanity while millions of miles from home.
Dr Gioia Massa, Nasa payload scientist for the Veggie experiment, said: ""Future spaceflight missions could involve four to six crew members living in a confined space for an extended period of time with limited communication.
""The further and longer humans go away from Earth the greater the need to be able to grow plants for food, atmosphere recycling and psychological benefits.""
She added: ""We have upcoming experiments that will look at the impacts of light quality on crop yield, nutrition and flavour.""",1

He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, had used gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
The process allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease and Mr Jiankui said the gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV.

242,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-nasa-idUSKBN18833L,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - NASA has delayed the first launch of its heavy-payload rocket until 2019 and decided against an idea floated by the White House to put astronauts aboard the capsule that is set to fly around the moon, the U.S. space agency said on Friday.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had hoped to launch the Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket in November 2018. The rocket will send the deep-space Orion capsule on a high lunar orbit.
The launch is part of NASA’s long-term program to use the rocket to get astronauts and equipment to Mars.
In February, at the behest of President Donald Trump’s administration, NASA began to weigh the implications of adding a two-person crew for the trial flight.
The conclusion of the study was to wait until a second flight before adding a crew, NASA Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot said.
The research “really reaffirmed that the baseline plan we have in place was the best way for us to go,” he told reporters on a conference call.
Adding systems to support a crew would have cost NASA $600 million to $900 million more and would likely have delayed the flight to 2020, he said.
Even without a crew, the SLS will not be ready to blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida until 2019, Lightfoot said, adding that the agency would have a more specific timeframe in about a month.
The delay would push back the rocket’s second flight beyond 2021, said NASA Associate Administrator William Gerstenmaier.
The delays are largely due to technical issues encountered during the development of SLS and Orion, as well as tornado damage to the rocket’s manufacturing plant in New Orleans.
By the end of the next fiscal year on September 30, 2018, NASA will have spent $23 billion on the rocket, capsule, launch site and support systems, according to an audit by NASA’s Office of Inspector General.
That excludes $9 billion spent on the mothballed Constellation lunar exploration program, which included initial development of the Orion and a second heavy-lift rocket.
Initially, the SLS rocket, which uses engines left over from the space shuttle program and shuttle-derived solid rocket boosters, will have the capacity to put about 77 tons (70 metric tons) into an orbit about 100 miles (160 km) above Earth.
Later versions are expected to carry nearly twice that load.
“We’re really building a system,” Gerstenmaier said. “It is much, much more than one flight.”

243,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/03/iss-air-leak-nasa-russia-theory-sabotage,"Nasa has expressed doubts over a Russian theory that a tiny hole that caused an air leak on the International Space Station (ISS) was the result of sabotage.
The breach detected on 29-30 August in a Russian space craft docked at the orbiting station was not the result of a manufacturing defect, according to the Russian space agency, which says it is investigating the possibility that it was drilled maliciously.
But Nasa, the US space agency, countered in a statement that ruling out defects “does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent”.
Russian space agency Roscosmos immediately launched an investigation into the hole, and its chief official, Dmitry Rogozin, went on television days later to say it could have been the result of foul play either back on Earth or by astronauts in space.
“Where it was made will be established by a second commission, which is at work now,” said Rogozin, a former Russian deputy prime minister who was placed under US sanctions over the Ukraine crisis in 2014.
The Russian daily Kommersant reported that an investigation at home was probing the possibility that US astronauts deliberately drilled the hole in order to get a sick colleague sent back home – something Russian officials later denied.
“Nasa and Roscosmos are both investigating the incident to determine the cause,” Nasa said on Wednesday.
ISS astronauts are planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information on the hole, which was quickly sealed.
An astronaut and cosmonaut are due to travel to the ISS on 11 October aboard a Russian Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

People in and outside of China rushed to question the ethical implications of the scientific breakthrough, reportedly the fruit of a Chinese researcher named Jiankui He from a university in Shenzhen.
There’s another twist to the story.
According to the AP, He had sought and received approval from Shenzhen HarMoniCare Women’s and Children’s Hospital to kick off the experiment. The MIT Technology Review’s report also linked to documents stating that He’s research received the green light from HarMoniCare’s medical ethics committee.
When contacted by TechCrunch, however, a HarMoniCare spokesperson said she was not aware of He’s genetic test and that the hospital is probing the validity of the circulated documents. TechCrunch will update when the case makes progress.
“What we can say for sure is that the gene editing process did not take place at our hospital. The babies were not born here either,” the spokesperson said of He’s project.
He, who studied at Rice and Stanford Universities, led a research team at Southern University of Science and Technology, which set out to eliminate the gene associated with HIV, smallpox and cholera by utilizing the CRISPR gene-editing tool, according to the MIT Technology Review. The technology is ethically fraught because changes to the embryo will pass on to future generations. He’s daring initiative is set to cause debate at the upcoming Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong, which he will attend.
It’s also noteworthy that HarMoniCare belongs to the vast Putian network, a fold of 8,000 private healthcare providers originated from Putian, Fujian province. That’s according to a list compiled by DXY.cn, a Chinese online community for healthcare professionals. Putian hospitals expanded across China quickly over the years with little government oversight until the death of a college student. In 2016, 21-year-old Wei Zexi died of cancer after receiving dubious treatment from a Putian hospital. The incident also provoked a public outcry over China’s largest search engine Baidu, which counted Putian hospitals as a major online advertiser.",0

MOSCOW – Astronauts hurriedly evacuated the U.S. section of the International Space Station and moved to its Russian module after a coolant problem emerged Wednesday, but Russian and U.S. officials insisted all six crew were not in any danger.
""The space station crew is safe,"" NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said.
An alarm indicating a possible ammonia leak in the cooling system early Wednesday prompted the crew to leave and seal off the American module, but further testing had NASA officials thinking it was just a sensor problem, NASA spokesman Mike Curie said.
Still, the crew planned to finish its work day in the Russian segment and sleep there overnight out of caution, Curie said. There's enough room and food for them to stay there a week but that's not likely to be necessary, he added.
The two space agencies differed on exactly what had occurred as the station orbited about 250 miles above the Earth. While the Russian space agency Roscosmos said there was a coolant leak, NASA said in a statement on its online television station there was still ""no concrete data that suggests that there was, in fact, an ammonia leak.""
Russia's Tass news agency said just about one-third of ammonia was left in the coolant system at the U.S. module and the rest had leaked out. It quoted Roscosmos chief Oleg Ostapenko as saying the situation was still being examined but an ""evacuation (of the entire station) is not on the agenda.""
NASA said the astronauts evacuated to the Russian module as a precaution.
""We saw an increase in water loop pressure, then later saw a cabin-pressure increase that could be indicative of an ammonia leak in the worst-case scenario,"" Jacobs said. ""So we protected for the worst-case scenario and isolated the crew in the Russian segment of the space station while the teams are evaluating the situation.""

247,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/28/chinas-dr-frankenstein-says-second-woman-early-pregnancy-gene/,"China’s “Dr Frankenstein,” He Jiankui, the scientist at the centre of a global controversy after claiming he produced the world’s first genetically edited babies, defended his work Wednesday and revealed a second woman was potentially pregnant as a result of his research.
“For this case, I feel proud,” said Mr He, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, in a speech to hundreds at the Human Genome Editing Summit in Hong Kong. “This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,” he said, without naming the journal.
Mr He’s claims of producing two gene-edited twin baby girls, dubbed ”Lulu” and “Nana,” and a second patient in “early stages” of pregnancy have stunned the world.
Though unconfirmed as they have yet to be peer-reviewed and published, if true, his work would be a massive breakthrough in biomedical research.
It’s also re-ignited worldwide debate about the enforcement of ethics and regulation of safety in such cutting edge work. New technology now allows scientists to selectively cut and paste DNA with incredible precision and could in the future be used to eradicate inherited illnesses.
But it could also be used to change traits such as height and eye colour, and most controversially, intelligence, potentially paving the way for genetically engineered ""designer babies"".
For years, Mr He said he worked in secret, on occasion consulting other scientific colleagues. Critics have pointed out that his self-funded research has skirted science ethics, especially as experts simply don’t know how gene-edited embryos will develop as they age into adulthood, and how altered DNA will pass down into future generations.
Mr He’s work may even be illegal – China, like the UK, bans gene editing in human embryos older than 14 days.
Mr He went on to describe his work, saying that eight couples had enrolled in the trial, but one pair had dropped out. All the fathers had HIV, and mothers who were not infected.
He also said he felt trial participants were informed properly and aware of the risks, describing an initial two-hour consultation, and then a second 70-minute meeting to review line-by-line a 20-page informed consent form.
Thirty-one embryos were created through in vitro fertilisation; of those, 70 percent had their DNA successfully altered to become HIV-resistant by using a method called Crispr-Cas9, he said.
Mr He’s work came to light at the start of this week when MIT Technology Review and the Associated Press published interviews with him, and members of his lab. His lab also posted detailed videos on YouTube about the work.
Chinese authorities and Southern University said Monday that they are investigating Mr He’s work and conduct. While his institution said it was unaware of the work, documents posted online about the trials appear to indicate Southern University was involved.
US professor Michael Deem is also now under investigation by his institution, Rice University, for his involvement in Mr He’s research. Mr Deem was advised Mr He at Rice, where he earned a PhD before going on to postdoctoral work at Stanford University.
More than 100 scientists, most of them in China, condemned the use of the Crispr-Cas9 technology as dangerous and unjustified. “Pandora’s box has been opened,” they said in an open letter Tuesday.

248,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html,"Chinese Scientist Claims to Use Crispr to Make First Genetically Edited Babies
The researcher, He Jiankui, offered no evidence or data to back up his assertions. If true, some fear the feat could open the door to “designer babies.”
Ever since scientists created the powerful gene editing technique Crispr, they have braced apprehensively for the day when it would be used to create a genetically altered human being. Many nations banned such work, fearing it could be misused to alter everything from eye color to I.Q.
Now, the moment they feared may have come. On Monday, a scientist in China announced that he had created the world’s first genetically edited babies, twin girls who were born this month.
The researcher, He Jiankui, said that he had altered a gene in the embryos, before having them implanted in the mother’s womb, with the goal of making the babies resistant to infection with H.I.V. He has not published the research in any journal and did not share any evidence or data that definitively proved he had done it.
But his previous work is known to many experts in the field, who said — many with alarm — that it was entirely possible he had.
“It’s scary,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, a gene editing expert at the University of California in San Francisco.
While the United States and many other countries have made it illegal to deliberately alter the genes of human embryos, it is not against the law to do so in China, but the practice is opposed by many researchers there. A group of 122 Chinese scientists issued a statement calling Dr. He’s actions “crazy” and his claims “a huge blow to the global reputation and development of Chinese science.”
If human embryos can be routinely edited, many scientists, ethicists and policymakers fear a slippery slope to a future in which babies are genetically engineered for traits — like athletic or intellectual prowess — that have nothing to do with preventing devastating medical conditions.
While those possibilities might seem far in the future, a different concern is urgent and immediate: safety. The methods used for gene editing can inadvertently alter other genes in unpredictable ways. Dr. He said that did not happen in this case, but it is a worry that looms over the field.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]
Dr. He made his announcement on the eve of the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong, saying that he had recruited several couples in which the man had H.I.V. and then used in vitro fertilization to create human embryos that were resistant to the virus that causes AIDS. He said he did it by directing Crispr-Cas9 to deliberately disable a gene, known as CCR₅, that is used to make a protein H.I.V. needs to enter cells.
Dr. He said the experiment worked for a couple whose twin girls were born in November. He said there were no adverse effects on other genes.
In a video that he posted, Dr. He said the father of the twins has a reason to live now that he has children, and that people with H.I.V. face severe discrimination in China.
Dr. He’s announcement was reported earlier by the MIT Technology Review and The Associated Press.
In an interview with the A.P. he indicated that he hoped to set an example to use genetic editing for valid reasons. “I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” he told the A.P. He added: “Society will decide what to do next.”
It is highly unusual for a scientist to announce a groundbreaking development without at least providing data that academic peers can review. Dr. He said he had gotten permission to do the work from the ethics board of the hospital Shenzhen Harmonicare, but the hospital, in interviews with Chinese media, denied being involved. Cheng Zhen, the general manager of Shenzhen Harmonicare, has asked the police to investigate what they suspect are “fraudulent ethical review materials,” according to the Beijing News.
The university that Dr. He is attached to, the Southern University of Science and Technology, said Dr. He has been on no-pay leave since February and that the school of biology believed that his project “is a serious violation of academic ethics and academic norms,” according to the state-run Beijing News.
In a statement late on Monday, China’s national health commission said it has asked the health commission in southern Guangdong province to investigate Mr. He’s claims.
Many scientists in the United States were appalled by the developments.
“I think that’s completely insane,” said Shoukhrat Mitalipov, director of the Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy at Oregon Health and Science University. Dr. Mitalipov broke new ground last year by using gene editing to successfully remove a dangerous mutation from human embryos in a laboratory dish.
Dr. Mitalipov said that unlike his own work, which focuses on editing out mutations that cause serious diseases that cannot be prevented any other way, Dr. He did not do anything medically necessary. There are other ways to prevent H.I.V. infection in newborns.
Richard Hynes, a cancer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who co-led an advisory group on human gene editing for the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine, said that group and a similar organization in Britain had determined that if human genes were to be edited, the procedure should only be done to address “serious unmet needs in medical treatment, it had to be well monitored, it had to be well followed up, full consent has to be in place.”
It is not clear why altering genes to make people resistant to H.I.V. is “a serious unmet need.” Men with H.I.V. do not infect embryos. Their semen contains the virus that causes AIDS, which can infect women, but the virus can be washed off their sperm before insemination. Or a doctor can inject a single sperm into an egg. In either case, the woman will not be infected and neither will the babies.
Dr. He got his Ph.D., from Rice University, in physics and his postdoctoral training, at Stanford, was with Stephen Quake, a professor of bioengineering and applied physics who works on sequencing DNA, not editing it.
Experts said that using Crispr would actually be quite easy for someone like Dr. He.
After coming to Shenzhen in 2012, Dr. He, at age 28, established a DNA sequencing company, Direct Genomics, and listed Dr. Quake on its advisory board. But, in a telephone interview on Monday, Dr. Quake said he was never associated with the company.

The US space agency said it would open the orbiting station to tourism and other business ventures.
There will be up to two short private astronaut missions per year, said Robyn Gatens, the deputy director of the ISS.
Nasa said that private astronauts would be permitted to travel to the ISS for up to 30 days, travelling on US spacecraft.

Nasa said that private commercial entities would be responsible for determining crew composition and ensuring that the private astronauts meet the medical and training requirements for spaceflight.
The two companies hired by Nasa are Elon Musk's SpaceX, which will use its Dragon capsule, and Boeing, which is building a spacecraft called the Starliner.
These companies are likely to charge any private astronaut a similar ""taxi fare"" to what they intend to charge Nasa for its astronauts - close to $60m per flight.
Nasa had previously banned any commercial use of the space station and prohibited astronauts from taking part in for-profit research.
Nasa does not own the station however - it was built, beginning in 1998, with Russia, which has taken a more relaxed approach in recent decades to commerce.
In 2001, US businessman Dennis Tito became the first tourist to visit when he paid Russia around $20 million for a round trip.
Nasa's announcement on Friday is part of a move towards full privatisation of the ISS. US President Donald Trump published a budget last year which called for the station to be defunded by the government by 2025.

After scrubbing the initial launch on Thursday, NASA’s new Orion spacecraft made its inaugural test flight on Friday, lifting off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 7:05 a.m. ET.
Friday’s 4 hour and 23 minute orbital mission will take Orion deeper into space than any spacecraft built for humans has traveled in more than 40 years.
The unmanned flight, dubbed Exploration Flight Test-1, will provide NASA with vital information on the spacecraft’s performance. NASA plans to eventually use Orion on ambitious manned missions to Mars and an asteroid.
The launch was pushed back from Thursday after a series of delays and technical glitches, with NASA engineers focusing their attention on the ‘fill-and-drain’ valves on the Delta IV Heavy Rocket that carries Orion on the first stage of its journey. In a blog post, NASA explained that liquid nitrogen valves failed to close properly late in Thursday’s countdown to launch. During normal operation the valves stay open during fueling and shut tight a few minutes before liftoff to seal the fuel tank.
The Delta IV rockets performed well during Friday's launch. ""It was an awesome job, an awesome job by the Delta IV team,"" said Mark Geyer, NASA's Orion program manager, shortly after liftoff.
The launch comes at a crucial time for U.S. spaceflight, which has recently suffered some high-profile setbacks. On Oct. 28 an unmanned Antares rocket exploded in a fireball shortly after liftoff from a NASA launchpad in Wallops Island, Virginia. Just three days later Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo space tourism rocket crashed during a test flight over the Mojave Desert, killing one of the two pilots aboard and seriously injuring the other.
During Friday’s test flight, Orion will orbit earth twice, covering more than 60,000 miles and reaching an altitude of 3,600 miles, almost 14 times beyond the International Space Station’s orbit. Orion is expected to reach its peak altitude 3 hours and 5 minutes into its flight.
The successor to the now-retired Space Shuttles is expected to reach a speed of 20,000 mph on its return through the earth’s atmosphere, generating temperatures around 4,000 degrees on the spacecraft’s heat shield. The 16.5-foot heat shield has been described by NASA as the largest and most advanced of its kind.
The mission will also provide a crucial test of Orion’s avionics and control systems, as well as the parachutes that will deploy on its return to earth. Orion is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge its durability for the day when astronauts climb aboard during the decade ahead.
Eventually Orion will carry a crew of four astronauts to deep space destinations, which include an asteroid to be corralled in lunar orbit for human exploration in the 2020s, followed by Mars in the 2030s.
Orion’s crew module is expected to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Baja California, where it will be retrieved by a joint NASA and U.S. Navy team. Orion will be brought back to the U.S. on board the USS Anchorage.
The $370 million test flight is being managed by NASA contractor Lockheed Martin. The Delta IV Heavy Rocket was built by United Launch Alliance.
Future Orion launches will use the mega rocket still under development by NASA, known as SLS or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS launch is targeted for 2018, unmanned, followed by the first piloted mission in 2021.

252,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-46368731,"He Jiankui defends 'world's first gene-edited babies'
- Published
A Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies has defended his work.
Speaking at a genome summit in Hong Kong, He Jiankui said he was ""proud"" of altering the genes of twin girls so they could not contract HIV.
His work, which he announced earlier this week, has not been verified.
Many scientists have condemned his announcement. Such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China.
Professor He's university - the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen - said it was unaware of the research project and would launch an investigation. It said Mr He had been on unpaid leave since February.
Prof He confirmed the university was not aware, adding he had funded the experiment by himself.
What has the scientist claimed?
Prof He announced earlier this week that he had altered the DNA of embryos - twin girls - to prevent them from contracting HIV.
On Wednesday, he spoke at the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong for the first time about his work since the uproar.
He revealed that the twin girls - known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"" - were ""born normal and healthy"", adding that there were plans to monitor the twins over the next 18 years.
He explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment; one couple later dropped out.
Prof He also said that the study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal.
He also said that ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo was in its early stages.
But he apologised that his research ""was leaked unexpectedly"", and added: ""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation.""
What do experts make of the claim?
By Robin Brant, BBC News, Hong Kong
No-one really knew if he was going to show. The auditorium was packed by the time He Jiankui walked on stage. This is the man who says he has given China a world first.
The handful of experts I spoke to, after they'd sat and listened to him, said they believed him. They believe this happened. But the big, big problem was that his speech and answers afterwards were scant on detail.
At times he was evasive, failing to give anything like the detail about his work - what he did, how he did it, who knew - that is required of any scientific project wishing to be regarded as credible.
He talked about the stigma attached to HIV/Aids in China and how important the family is to society, but he didn't give the names of ""some experts"" he claimed had reviewed his work and offered feedback.
Why is it this controversial?
The Crispr gene editing tool he claims to have used is not new to the scientific world, and was first discovered in 2012.
It works by using ""molecular scissors"" to alter a very specific strand of DNA - either cutting it out, replacing it or tweaking it.
Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos.
But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes.
Prof He's recent claims were widely criticised by other scientists.
""If true, this experiment is monstrous. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer,"" Prof Julian Savulescu, an ethics expert at the University of Oxford, told the BBC.
""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit.""
Many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans.
Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby.
Prof He's experiment is prohibited under Chinese laws, Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xu Nanping told state media.
China allows in-vitro human embryonic stem cell research for a maximum period of 14 days, Mr Xu clarified.",0

- NASA and SpaceX are targeting May 27 for the launch of Demo-2.
- Demo-2 will launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time since the end of the Space Shuttle program nearly a decade ago.
- This will be the first crewed launch for Elon Musk's space company.
NASA and SpaceX are targeting May 27 for the launch of Demo-2, the first launch of NASA astronauts from the U.S. since 2011 and the first crewed launch for Elon Musk's space company.
As its name implies, Demo-2 will be the second time SpaceX launches its Crew Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. But, unlike Demo-1 last year, this time two astronauts will be on board.
Demo-2 is set to liftoff at 4:32 p.m. EDT from launchpad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be strapped into a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that is sitting on top of a Falcon 9 rocket.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine earlier this month explained to CNBC why Demo-2 has been a priority for the agency.
""We need access to the International Space Station from the United States of America. Commercial Crew is the program that's going to make that happen. It's essential for our country to have that capability,"" Bridenstine said.
NASA has awarded SpaceX more than $3.1 billion under the Commercial Crew program to fund development of the capsule. The company is also contributing hundreds of millions of dollars of its own funds when needed. Boeing is also developing its Starliner spacecraft to compete for contracts, with the company having received more than $4.8 billion in awards since Commercial Crew began.
A historic moment for SpaceX
The Demo-2 mission will represent a major milestone for Musk's SpaceX in its goal to begin regularly flying people to space. The company has been launching spacecraft, satellites and cargo since its founding in 2002 but never humans — professional astronauts or otherwise.
The launch will be the final flight test for SpaceX's systems before NASA certifies it for operational use. Bridenstine explained previously that the plan is to bring Behnken and Hurley back from the space station after about two or three months. About a month after they return, NASA and SpaceX will launch Crew-1, which the agency considers to be Crew Dragon's ""first operational"" flight. Crew-1 will mark the official start of SpaceX flying astronauts on regular missions to the ISS.
Extra precautions amid a pandemic
Bridenstine noted that NASA and SpaceX are taking extra measures to protect the astronauts and other workers given the coronavirus crisis. While NASA centers across the country have been locked down, the agency designated Demo-2 as ""mission essential,"" allowing it to move forward despite government shelter-at-home restrictions. About 350 NASA employees work for the Commercial Crew program, using personal protective equipment when needed and are working in rotations.
The agency is ""making sure that we're practicing all of our social distancing measures,"" Bridenstine said. ""We're using shifts of workers in a way that we can enable more distancing.""
NASA also said its astronaut trainers ""are closely adhering to CDC recommendations on infection control,"" with a ""limited"" number of employees coming in contact with Behnken and Hurley.
""We always quarantine all of the astronauts before they go to the International Space Station,"" Bridenstine said. ""Now we're taking even more precautions.""

NASA's quest to send astronauts out into the solar system begins this week with a two-laps-around-Earth test flight.
The new Orion spacecraft is not going to Mars just yet; Thursday's debut will be unmanned and last just 4½ hours. But it will be the farthest a built-for-humans capsule has flown since the Apollo moon missions, shooting 3,600 miles out into space in order to gain enough momentum to re-enter the atmosphere at a scorching 20,000 mph.
The dry run, if all goes well, will end with a Pacific splashdown off Mexico's Baja coast. Navy ships will recover the capsule, a la Apollo, for future use.
This initial Orion is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge its durability for the day when astronauts do climb aboard during the decade ahead. Advertised destinations include an asteroid to be corralled in lunar orbit for human exploration in the 2020s, followed by Mars in the 2030s.
""We're approaching this as pioneers,"" said William Hill of NASA's exploration systems development office. ""We're going out to stay eventually. ... It's many, many decades away, but that's our intent.""
Lockheed Martin Corp. built the capsule and is staging the $370 million test flight for NASA.
Orion is NASA's first new spacecraft for humans in more than a generation, succeeding the now-retired space shuttles. Unlike the capsules under development by two U.S. companies for space station crew transport, Orion is meant for the long haul, both in time and space; it would be supplemented with habitats for potential Mars trips.
""We need a spacecraft that's going to be sturdy enough and robust enough"" to carry astronauts well beyond low-Earth orbit for weeks and months at a time, said Lockheed Martin's Bryan Austin, a former NASA shuttle flight director who will oversee Orion's maiden voyage.
""That's how Orion really separates itself from the commercial field. They're there to get you to station and back. Of course, we're there to be hardened enough to sustain it for that long duration.""
For this orbital tryout, a Delta IV rocket will hoist Orion from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Liftoff is scheduled for 7:05 a.m. EST, just after sunrise. The rocket, with Orion and its launch escape tower at the tiptop, stretches 242 feet high.
Future Orion launches will use the mega rocket still under development by NASA, known as SLS or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS launch is targeted for 2018, unmanned, followed by the first piloted mission in 2021.
No one at NASA is pleased with such a poky pace. At best, it will be seven years before astronauts fly Orion — anywhere. By comparison, it took eight years from the time President John Kennedy announced his intentions of landing a man on the moon — before John Glenn had even rocketed into orbit — to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's lunar boot prints in 1969.
Given the present budget situation, ""it is what it is,"" said Kennedy Space Center's director Robert Cabana, a former astronaut. And the presidential election ahead could bring further delays and uncertainties.
In any case, don't confuse Orion with NASA's old-time Apollo capsules.
For one, the 11-foot-tall Orion is designed to hold four astronauts, one more than Apollo. For relatively short outings of three weeks or so, Orion could accommodate six.
""People often ask us, 'Hey, this thing looks like a capsule, it looks like Apollo,' and people will confuse that with 'it's not new,' "" said Scott Wilson, NASA's Orion production operations manager. While physics drives the capsule's outer bell shape, ""everything else in the capsule is state-of-the-art,"" he said.
""Everything, from the thrusters, from the environmental control systems, to the structure itself"" is benefiting from all the advances in technology, Wilson said. With no one on board, this first Orion will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, simulators instead of cockpit displays and, obviously, no life-support.
The heat shield on Orion's base, designed to protect the craft from the searing temperatures of atmospheric re-entry, is 16.5 feet across and is the biggest, most advanced of its kind ever made, according to NASA. On this flight, Orion will reach close to 4,000 degrees, not quite the 5,000 degrees that would be generated from a moon mission, but close enough for a shakedown.
That's why Orion will aim for a 3,600-mile-high peak altitude, more than 14 times higher than the International Space Station — to pick up enough speed to come back fast and hot.
NASA is pulling out all the stops for Orion's inaugural run. The space agency has teamed up with the nonprofit, educational Sesame Street Workshop to promote not just this mission, but the effort to send astronauts to Mars. Comics, video and graphics are building up the countdown.
""The astronauts of the 2030s and beyond are today's preschoolers,"" NASA explains on its website.
There's even a new countdown clock to herald the event.
Last week, Kennedy Space Center took down its familiar launch countdown clock dating back to the Apollo program; officials said it had become too expensive to fix and maintain. A new multimedia display went up in its place, just as long at 26 feet, but taller at 7 feet.",1

NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, along with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka, returned from the International Space Station to a coronavirus-ravaged world early on Friday morning.
The Soyuz capsule carrying the trio made a parachute-assisted landing at 1:16 a.m. EDT in Kazakhstan, NASA said.
“Three space travelers returned home today!” tweeted NASA.
NASA ASTRONAUTS MAKE HISTORY WITH FIRST ALL-FEMALE SPACEWALK
Russian officials said they took stringent measures to protect the crew members amid the pandemic. The recovery team and medical personnel assigned to help the three out of the capsule and to perform post-flight checks were under close medical observation for nearly a month before the landing and tested for the coronavirus.
After their landing in Kazakhstan, the crew members smiled as they talked to medical experts wearing masks.
Morgan reached the orbiting space lab on July 20, 2019, and spent 272 days on the space station, encompassing 4,352 earth orbits.
“Morgan’s extended stay in space will increase knowledge about how the human body responds to longer-duration spaceflight, through the various investigations he supported, including the Fluid Shifts study,” explained NASA in a statement. “He also conducted seven spacewalks – totaling 45 hours and 48 minutes – four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station’s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer as it looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.""

Meir also made history when she took part in the first all-female spacewalk with fellow NASA astronaut Christina Koch on Oct. 18, 2019. Meir and Koch ultimately conducted three all-female spacewalks with Koch, totaling 21 hours and 44 minutes, NASA said.

The Russian Soyuz rocket carrying cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev and NASA astronaut Steven Swanson lifted off at 5:17 p.m. EDT/2117 GMT from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
“The crew is doing great, everything is nominal aboard,” a Russian ground controller, speaking through a translator, said during a live broadcast of the launch on NASA Television.
The Soyuz capsule perched atop the rocket is scheduled to reach the space station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth, about six hours after launch.
The arrival of Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson will return the station to a full six-member crew. The orbital outpost, a project of 15 nations, has been short-staffed since two other cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut returned to Earth on March 11.
The space station partnership, overseen by the United States and Russia, so far has been immunized from the political and economic fallout following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
“We don’t want to see political turmoil and it could ultimately get in the way of our spaceflight, but from the operator standpoint ... this is absolutely a non-issue for us,” NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is due to fly to the station in May, said in a CBS News interview on March 18.
“I mean, we’re three really good friends climbing into a Soyuz (capsule) to fly into space. All politics aside, there’s no doubt it’s going to work for us,” Wiseman said.
The United States currently pays Russia more than $63 million per seat to fly its astronauts to and from the space station.
The Russian part of the station taps electricity generated by U.S.-owned and operated solar wing panels and supplements its ground-based communications with NASA’s orbital satellite network, among other U.S.-provided services.
One of the first orders of business for the newly arriving station crewmembers will be to capture and berth a Space Exploration Technologies’ Dragon cargo capsule, which is due to launch on Sunday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

Scott Kelly Spent a Year in Orbit. His Body Is Not Quite the Same.
NASA scientists compared the astronaut to his earthbound twin, Mark. The results hint at what humans will have to endure on long journeys through space.
For 340 days, Scott Kelly circled the Earth aboard the International Space Station, gathering data about himself.
He drew blood from his arms. He saved his urine. He played computer games to test his memory and reaction speed. He measured the shape of his eyes.
Two hundred and forty miles below, Mr. Kelly’s twin brother, Mark, who also served as an astronaut, carried out identical tests. Now, a comparison of these two men has provided a unique opportunity to learn what happens to the human body in space — down to the molecular level.
On Thursday, just over three years after Mr. Kelly, 55, returned to Earth, NASA researchers reported that his body experienced a vast number of changes while in orbit. DNA mutated in some of his cells. His immune system produced a host of new signals. His microbiome gained new species of bacteria.
[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]
Many of these biological changes seemed harmless, disappearing after he returned to Earth. But others — including genetic mutations and, after his return, declines in cognitive test scores — did not correct themselves, provoking concern among scientists.
Some considered the risks manageable, while others wondered whether it would ever be safe for astronauts to take long journeys to Mars or beyond. Final answers will depend on studies of still more astronauts.
“I believe it’s the most comprehensive assessment of human beings to date,” said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, who was not involved in the study. “I don’t know that there’s been anything close to this.”
Although astronauts have been carried aloft for almost six decades, there’s much about life in space that scientists still don’t understand. With investigations like the NASA Twins Study, published in the journal Science, the agency hopes to answer some of the questions before sending astronauts on longer flights.
In 2012, NASA picked Mr. Kelly to join the Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko aboard the space station for a yearlong examination of the challenges of space travel, twice as long as previous studies.
In the run-up to the mission’s announcement, Mr. Kelly asked officials if they had any plans to compare him to his twin. “We have these two guys who are genetically identical,” Mr. Kelly recalled telling them. “They’d make for an interesting experiment.”
Officials had no such plans, but soon decided to take him up on the offer. Mark Kelly agreed, and the NASA Twins Study was born. (Mark Kelly, who retired from NASA in 2011 and is the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, is running for John McCain’s Senate seat in Arizona.)
By comparing the brothers, NASA hoped to better understand the changes that Scott Kelly experienced during his mission.
“The fact that they’re twins really narrows down the alternatives,” said Susan Bailey, a cancer biologist at Colorado State University and a co-author of the new study. “We can say that, as best as we can tell, these changes are due to spaceflight.”
Ten research teams designed experiments for the twins; they are likely to bring an avalanche of research. But to Mr. Kelly, the experience didn’t feel very different from previous missions.
Drawing his own blood in zero gravity, for example, was a familiar routine. “I’ve had a couple spills in my time,” Mr. Kelly said. “You just reach out and grab the blobs of blood.”
By many measures, the scientists eventually found, Mr. Kelly changed about as much as astronauts who stayed on the space station for only six months. Eventually the pace of biological change slowed, suggesting that perhaps the human body reaches a new equilibrium in space.
But Mr. Kelly’s body was also altered in some surprising ways.
Dr. Bailey studied special sections of his DNA called telomeres, which sit at the end of chromosomes, protecting them from deterioration.
As people age, their telomeres tend to get shorter. Stress — such as radiation or pollution — may hasten aging by fraying telomeres even faster than usual.
Strangely, the average length of Mr. Kelly’s telomeres increased in space, rather than decreasing, as if his cells were becoming more youthful.
Regular exercise and a healthy diet might be part of the reason. But going to space also might have awakened a quiet population of stem cells in Mr. Kelly’s body, Dr. Bailey said.
His cells might not have grown longer telomeres, in other words. Instead, perhaps his body manufactured a new supply of young cells with longer telomeres.
Activated genes
Going to space also appeared to trigger a genetic shift in Mr. Kelly. Thousands of genes that were once quiet increased their activity — genes that remained quiet in Mark Kelly’s body back on Earth. The longer Scott Kelly stayed aloft, the greater the number of genes becoming active.
Some of the awakened genes are known to encode proteins that help fix damaged DNA. That would make sense, given that radiation levels in the International Space Station are higher than on Earth.
Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, estimated that Mr. Kelly was exposed to 48 times more radiation than the average exposure on Earth over the course of a year. His cells might have been busy repairing radiation injury.
A number of other activated genes, however, play roles in the immune system. What exactly triggers those changes isn’t clear.
It may be the overall stress of life in the space station provokes an immune response. But recent studies have also shown that latent viruses can awaken in astronauts.
Or maybe it’s that the immune system, which never evolved for survival in space, simply gets confused.
“Is it good or bad? We just know it’s more,” Dr. Mason, a co-author of the new study, said of the immune activity. “To know for sure, we’d need more astronauts.”
Mr. Kelly’s return to Earth on March 1, 2016, proved to be one of the biggest moments — biologically speaking — of the whole mission. His body showed signs of intense stress, and his immune system was in high gear.
Michael Snyder, a geneticist at Stanford University and co-author of the research, cautioned that this response might not be typical. “Maybe he got a viral infection,” he speculated. “This is why you want to see it in more people.”
Despite that shock, Mr. Kelly’s body mostly returned to preflight condition. Some species of bacteria that thrived in his gut while he was in space, for example, became rare again on his landing.
The strange lengthening of Mr. Kelly’s telomeres disappeared after less than 48 hours on Earth. In fact, Dr. Bailey and her colleagues started finding many cells with telomeres that were shorter than before Mr. Kelly went to space.
“People have asked me, ‘Well, is going to space the fountain of youth?’” said Dr. Bailey. “I don’t think so. If it is, you’re going to have to stay up there forever.”
‘Fighting through quicksand’
Some aspects of Mr. Kelly’s biology didn’t return to the preflight norm.
Six months after he came back to Earth, 8.7 percent of his genes were still behaving in an altered way. Judging from the small size of this shift, Dr. Snyder described the change as modest.
The researchers also found that Mr. Kelly didn’t do as well on his return on cognitive exams. “He got slower and less accurate on virtually all of the tests,” said Dr. Mathias Basner, a cognitive scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.
It’s possible that some biological change was to blame. But Dr. Basner noted that Mr. Kelly also faced a lot of demands back on Earth, including a busy schedule of television interviews and public speaking.
And on an unconscious level, he may no longer have been pushing himself. “I mean, he basically retired the moment he hit the ground, and so perhaps he just wasn’t as motivated any longer,” Dr. Basner said.
In his 2017 memoir, “Endurance,” Mr. Kelly describes struggling after his return with pain, sleeping troubles and other woes. One night he felt as if he was “fighting through quicksand,” he wrote.
In an interview, Mr. Kelly speculated those difficulties might be to blame for his cognitive scores. “It’s hard to concentrate when you’re not feeling well,” he said.
Another enduring change, scientists found, was a collection of genetic mutations that Mr. Kelly gained in space. “We see them appear in flight, and then they persisted afterward,” Dr. Mason said.
Sometimes radiation triggers a type of mutation that makes cells prone to gain still more mutations as they divide. Eventually, the cells may start growing uncontrollably — “taking steps on the road to cancer,” Dr. Bailey said.
Peter Campbell, a cancer biologist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Britain who was not involved in the new study, said scientists can’t predict what the extra mutations will mean for Mr. Kelly’s health.
“It is hard to be sure, but I believe those sorts of numbers would be associated with a moderate increase in cancer risk,” he said.
These two lingering changes — in Mr. Kelly’s cognition and DNA — left a number of experts concerned about the risks of a trip to Mars, which could take a year.
Gary Strangman, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School, said that a decrease in speed and accuracy “could potentially have serious consequences on long-duration missions.”
After a grueling journey to the red planet, astronauts would probably need to take quick, accurate actions as they landed.
“If you had a period of slower cognitive processing speed and difficulty with balance and eye-head coordination, those behaviors would be at risk,” said Rachael Seidler, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Florida.
A heavy load of genetic mutations would not present immediate dangers to astronauts on their missions, but it might raise their lifelong risks of cancer.
Dr. Mason estimated that a mission to Mars would expose an astronaut to eight times more radiation than Mr. Kelly experienced.
“Every effort will need to be made to limit exposure to astronauts during periods of prolonged space travel,” said Charles Swanton, a cancer biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain who was not involved in the new study.
Dr. Topol, of the Scripps institute, found the implications of Mr. Kelly’s experience to be grim.
“The main conclusion I got from this paper, based on all the objective data, is why would anybody want to go to Mars or be in space?” he said. “Because this is really scary.”
Jerry Shay, a cell biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, was much more optimistic. He held out hope for countermeasures that would protect astronauts.
Already he and his colleagues, for example, are testing drugs to trigger cells to fix DNA damaged by radiation. “I think all these problems are solvable,” Dr. Shay said.
NASA has begun sifting through all these results to help plan the next round of missions to the International Space Station.
“It won’t be a replication of what you saw in the Twins Study,” said Jennifer Fogarty, the chief scientist at NASA’s Human Research Program.
“We’re going to learn from that, and we’re going to be smarter about the questions we ask. There’s a lot of fascinating stuff to go measure. It’s just not clear what it means.”
Dr. Bailey, for her part, plans to keep on studying Mr. Kelly’s baffling telomeres. Solving that mystery might shed light on ordinary aging and the diseases it brings.
“When we figure out the how and why of that, it’s going to be important for astronauts as well as for us mere Earthlings,” she said.",1
258,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11274100/Orion-fails-to-take-off-on-its-maiden-voyage.html,"A series of mishaps has forced mission controllers to scrub today's planned launch of the Orion spacecraft that could one day take astronauts to Mars.
Wind gusts, sticking fuel valves and a rogue boat entering the launch area meant the rocket carrying Orion could not blast off within its launch window.
The space craft had been due to take off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 12.05, UK time.
Another attempt to fire Orion into orbit will now be made tomorrow morning.
Mike Curie, from the American space agency Nasa, said: ""Despite the valiant attempts of the launch team and mission managers around the country, we basically ran out of time in trying to troubleshoot.""
Orion was due to make an unmanned test flight twice around the Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph.
The mission is the first since the Apollo moon landings half a century ago to take a spacecraft built for manned flight into deep space.
During its 4.5-hour flight Orion will travel 3,609 miles from Earth, 15 times the distance to the International Space Station.
Nasa hopes to use Orion to put astronauts back on the moon by 2020 and take them to Mars in the 2030s. A midway mission to an asteroid is also on the cards.
Even though the new spacecraft bristles with the latest technology, it bears a striking resemblance to the Apollo command module that carried Neil Armstrong to the moon in 1969.
But unnlike the Apollo module, which carried three astronauts, Orion is designed for a crew of four.
Measuring 16.5 feet across, it is larger than Apollo, which had a diameter of 12.8 feet.
The spacecraft is to be carried in to space by a Delta IV Heavy, the largest US rocket currently in service.

‘It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,’ NASA’s Jessica Meir says
Astronauts currently residing aboard the International Space Station have braced for returning to Earth amid the coronavirus pandemic.
When speaking to CBS News, astronaut Jessica Meir confessed she expects to feel more isolated upon returning to Earth during the pandemic instead of how she’s felt on the space centre.
“It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” Ms Meir said on Friday. “The Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place.”
“It certainly will be very difficult for me to not be able to give some hugs to my family and friends,” she added. “That’s something after being up here for seven months, and being the type of person that I am, that’s going to be difficult for me. ... I think that I will actually feel more isolated on the Earth than I did up here, just because that’s part of our expected routine up here.”
Astronaut Andrew Morgan, who also is aboard the space centre, added members of his profession typically expected Earth to change in some ways upon returning, but not quite at a pandemic level.
“We can watch news up here, and we’ve been talking to friends and families to try to paint a picture,” Mr Morgan said. “But from up here, it’s hard to understand what has transpired and how life will be different when we return.”
Mr Morgan came aboard the International Space Station in July, and Ms Meir, who participated in three all-female space walks, in September.
Both of the astronauts will disembark in a Soyuz capsule with Russian Oleg Skripochka next Friday, which will land in Kazakhstan. Their spots in the space station were replaced by three other astronauts, including NASA’s Chris Cassidy, on Thursday.
Those three astronauts joining the International Space Station have been in strict quarantine since the beginning of March to prevent bringing any virus into space.
“I did not come in contact with anyone other than those immediate people involved with the launch preparation,” Mr Cassidy said. “And those people were also in the same quarantine as I was. And we were really strict about it.”
The landing of the Soyuz capsule next week will come exactly 50 years after Apollo 13 landed in the Pacific Ocean.
“Once again, now there’s a crisis and the crisis is on Earth,” Mr Morgan said.
He joined NASA in 2013 after working as an emergency physician with the US Army. Watching healthcare workers battle the pandemic from afar has been difficult for Mr Morgan.
“As an emergency physician, I know what it’s like to be in a hospital or on the front lines of a field hospital,” he said. “I’m very proud to be part of that profession, but at the same time, I feel guilt that I am as separated from it as I could be right now.”

By Michelle Roberts
Health editor, BBC News online
- Published
Significant doubts have emerged about claims from a Chinese scientist that he has helped make the world's first genetically edited babies.
Prof He Jiankui says the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had their DNA altered as embryos to prevent them from contracting HIV.
His claims, filmed by Associated Press, are unverified and have sparked outrage from other scientists, who have called the idea monstrous.
Such work is banned in most countries.
Future generations
Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos.
But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes.
And many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans.
Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby.
'Designer babies'
But Prof He, who was educated at Stanford in the US and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, says he used gene-editing tools to make two twin baby girls, known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"".
In a video, he claims to have eliminated a gene called CCR5 to make the girls resistant to HIV should they ever come into contact with the virus.
He says his work is about creating children who would not suffer from diseases, rather than making designer babies with bespoke eye colour or a high IQ.
""I understand my work will be controversial - but I believe families need this technology and I'm willing to take the criticism for them,"" he says in the video.
'Highly treatable'
However, several organisations, including a hospital, linked to the claim have denied any involvement.
The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said it had been unaware of the research project and will now launch an investigation.
And other scientists say if the reports are true, Prof He has gone too far, experimenting on healthy embryos without justification.
Prof Robert Winston, Emeritus Professor of Fertility Studies and Professor of Science and Society at Imperial College London, said: ""If this is a false report, it is scientific misconduct and deeply irresponsible.
""If true, it is still scientific misconduct.""
Dr Dusko Ilic, an expert in stem cell science at King's College London, said: ""If this can be called ethical, then their perception of ethics is very different to the rest of the world's.""
He argues that HIV is highly treatable and that if the infection is kept under control with drugs, then there is almost no risk of the parents passing it on to the baby anyway.
Too risky
Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at the University of Oxford, said: ""If true, this experiment is monstrous. The embryos were healthy - no known diseases.
""Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.
""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit.""
Scientists say baby gene editing may one day be justifiable, but that more checks and measures are needed before allowing it.
Dr Yalda Jamshidi, an expert in human genetics at St George's, University of London, said: ""We know very little about the long term effects, and most people would agree that experimentation on humans for an avoidable condition just to improve our knowledge is morally and ethically unacceptable.
""Whether the results stand up to scrutiny or not we need as a society to think hard and fast about when and where we are willing to take the risks that come with any new therapeutic treatment, particularly ones that could affect future generations.""",0

Team members were quarantined for month before launch, and were unable to meet family and reporters as usual.
A US-Russian space crew blasted off Thursday to the International Space Station (ISS) following a tight quarantine amid the coronavirus pandemic.
NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Roscosmos’ Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner lifted off as scheduled at 08:05am GMT from the Russian-operated Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
Their Soyuz MS-16 spacecraft was set to dock at the station six hours later.
Russian space officials have taken extra precautions to protect the crew during training and pre-flight preparations as the coronavirus outbreak has swept the world.
Speaking to journalists on Wednesday in a video link from Baikonur, Cassidy said the crew has been in “a very strict quarantine” for the past month and is in good health.
“We all feel fantastic,” he said.
Cassidy pointed out that normally they would be talking to many people at the day-before-launch news conference, but instead were talking to cameras because of the pandemic.
“Obviously, we’d love to have our families here with us, but it’s what we understand we have to do to be safe,” Cassidy said. “The whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.”
Cassidy’s wife, Peggy, had returned to the US from the Russian cosmonaut training centre in Star City outside Moscow a few days before the crew left for Baikonur.
Commander Anatoly Ivanishin also noted that extra measures have been taken to keep the crew healthy and safe before launch, adding that none of the crew has had any guests – no family or friends.
“We’ve been completely isolated at this final stage of training,” Ivanishin said.
Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin said earlier this week that nine employees of the state corporation have tested positive for coronavirus.
Roscosmos, which controls a sprawling network of production plants and launch facilities, has about 200,000 employees, Rogozin said.
As part of additional precautions, Roscosmos has barred reporters from covering the launch contrary to usual practice.
Ivanishin and Vagner had trained as back-ups for the other two Russians and were picked for the flight only in February after a member of the original Russian crew suffered an eye injury.
As a result, neither have clothes awaiting them at the space station. Ivanishin said they will be taking some clothes with them on the Soyuz, and the next Russian supply ship will deliver more later.
The mission is the third space flight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and the first for Vagner.
The ISS is currently operated by Russian Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, who are due to return to Earth on April 17.",1
263,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186511/spacex-nasa-crew-dragon-astronauts-launch-may-international-space-station,"After six years of developing a new passenger spacecraft for NASA, SpaceX is finally on track to launch its very first crew to the International Space Station in mid-to-late May — but uncertainty surrounds the flight as the novel coronavirus pandemic worsens in the US. On Wednesday, NASA put out a call for press to cover the mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida, but if current restrictions remain in place over the next couple of months, changes will likely need to be made as the mission proceeds.
Despite the pandemic, the mission itself is set to be historic. The last time astronauts launched to orbit from the United States was July 8th, 2011 — the last flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle. Since then, NASA astronauts have relied on Russia’s Soyuz rocket to get to and from the International Space Station. Each seat on that vehicle costs the space agency more than $70 million. In order to move launches back to US soil, in 2014 NASA tasked two companies — Boeing and SpaceX — with developing private space capsules that can ferry astronauts to the ISS, part of an initiative called the Commercial Crew Program. Now, SpaceX is finally poised to launch its first human passengers on its new Crew Dragon vehicle, marking the first time a commercial vehicle has launched people to orbit.
NASA has been hyping this mission for years, but the timing is obviously unlucky. Companies and organizations across the US are telling employees to work from home, and NASA is no different. As of yesterday, all of NASA’s centers and facilities are requiring their employees to work from home, with an exception for personnel considered “mission-essential.” NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley has even more stringent restrictions since two of its employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, SpaceX employees have been told they should stay home if they’re feeling sick, though SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has downplayed the risks associated with the virus.
However, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine says the agency is still moving ahead with important missions, including SpaceX’s trip, which will carry NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS for a quick stay. But schedules are subject to change as the pandemic continues to worsen. One spaceport in South America has already suspended launches to protect its personnel and people living near the site.
“NASA is proactively monitoring the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation as it evolves,” NASA said in a statement. “The agency will continue to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the agency’s chief health and medical officer and communicate any updates that may impact mission planning or media access, as they become available.”
Protocols are already in place to make sure astronauts are in peak health when they fly. Even before the pandemic began, NASA required all astronauts to go into quarantine two weeks ahead of their missions to orbit to ensure they don’t carry any unwanted illnesses with them to space. (There’s a full-body wipe-down before flight, too, according to Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield.)
With the astronauts heavily monitored before flight, things appear to be moving forward for the mission, but a lot could quickly change between now and the targeted launch in May. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear like the pandemic is going to get much better by May. In fact, researchers are predicting that the disease spread may not peak until late May or early June, according to a new report from Imperial College London.
That may mean that there will be few people able to visit Cape Canaveral, Florida, to witness the historic launch. Even if NASA and SpaceX have no problems moving forward with additional tests and processing for the mission and the launch goes ahead as planned, current social distancing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against large gatherings. That would be a stark contrast to the large crowds that gathered to watch the last launch of the Space Shuttle in 2011.

Rewriting your DNA is getting closer to reality: A revolutionary technology is opening new frontiers for genetic engineering - a promise of cures for intractable diseases along with anxiety about designer babies.
Hundreds of scientists and ethicists from around the world are gathering in Washington this week to debate the boundaries of human gene editing, amid worry that the fast-moving research may outpace safety and ethics scrutiny.
It's a question that gained urgency after Chinese researchers made the first attempt at editing genes in human embryos, a laboratory experiment that didn't work well but did raise the prospect of one day altering human heredity - passing modified DNA to future generations.
""This is a technology that could have profound implications for permanent alteration of the human genome,"" molecular biologist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in the journal Nature on the eve of the international summit.
Doudna co-invented the most-used gene-editing tool, and her calls for scientists, policymakers and the public to determine the right balance in how it's eventually used led to this week's gathering.
At issue are tools to edit precisely genes inside living cells, finding specific sections of DNA to slice and repair or replace much like a biological version of cut-and-paste software. There are a few methods but one with the wonky name CRISPR-Cas9 is so fast, cheap and simple for biologists to use that research is booming.
Scientists are engineering animals with humanlike disorders to unravel the gene defects that fuel them. They're building stronger immune cells, and developing potential treatments for muscular dystrophy, sickle cell disease and cancer. They're trying to grow transplantable human organs inside pigs. They're even hatching mutant mosquitoes designed to be incapable of spreading malaria, and exploring ways to wipe out invasive species.
As for that preliminary embryo research, it's nowhere near ready for real-world use, but there's controversy over whether and how to continue such experiments to see if it eventually will work.
On one side are scientists who say the ultimate goal is to prevent mom and dad from passing devastating diseases to their children.
""This technology is poised to transform preventive medicine,"" Harvard geneticist George Church wrote in Nature.
He added a warning: If mainstream scientists can't explore heritable gene editing, that ""could put a damper on the best medical research and instead drive the practice underground to black markets and uncontrolled medical tourism.""
Doudna adds that a complete ban on such research could block important discoveries. British researchers, for example, plan to alter embryos to study early human development, work that could shed light on miscarriages.
On the other side are critics who say that so-called germline editing - altering sperm, eggs or embryos to affect future generations - has been widely regarded as a line science shouldn't cross. They argue that standard in vitro fertilization techniques to test the genetics of embryos before they're implanted, or before adoption, are alternatives. And they raise the specter of parents who can afford designer babies with specific traits.
""The medical arguments are tenuous and the possible social consequences are grave,"" said Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society advocacy group.
In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health has said it won't fund human germline editing research, although private funding is still possible. Laws and guidelines in other countries vary widely.",0
265,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213330/nasa-roscosmos-astronaut-soyuz-rocket-launch-chris-cassidy-coronavirus,"In the wee hours of the morning on April 9th, three astronauts are set to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan and journey to the International Space Station, where they’ll join three crew members already living and working in orbit. Because this flight is launching during a pandemic, tighter restrictions and protocols are in place to prevent the novel coronavirus from making its way to space.
The three people headed to orbit Thursday include NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. Ivanishin and Vagner are last-minute replacements to the flight after one of the original cosmonauts assigned to the mission suffered an eye injury. For Cassidy and Ivanishin, this will be their third trip to orbit, while it will be the first for Vagner. The crew will stay on the ISS for a total of six months.
Final preparations for a trip to the space station from Russia usually begin in Star City — a small town just outside of Moscow. After a brief stay, the crew then heads to Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where their rocket launches, and enters a two-week quarantine period. Even before the pandemic, NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, required crews to enter a two-week quarantine ahead of their launch date, to ensure the travelers don’t inadvertently carry a nasty bug to space.
However, quarantine procedures accelerated slightly while the crews were still in Star City. Around the time of Cassidy’s arrival at the beginning of March, stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures were enacted all over the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
“Had I been in normal quarantine, I probably could have gone out to some restaurants and left the immediate parameters of the Star City area and just been smart about where we went,” Cassidy said during a round of press interviews on March 19th. “But not this time. We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.”
Pavel Vlasov, head of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, confirmed that the crews started quarantining earlier than usual. “They do not go on any trips even the traditional like visiting the Kremlin wall and [Sergei] Korolev’s house before setting off to Baikonur,” Vlasov said in a statement on the Roscosmos website.

Our crew is now less than 48 hours from lift off, soon coming to the end of our quarantine period. I’ve truly enjoyed reading about and watching all of the humorous things people are creating to help lighten the mood during this stressful time. One example is this video written and filmed by a good friend and the Magnuson family. It’s silly, but the message is spot on…the responsibility to shelter in place lies with every one of us. We all must do our part! #Nasa #Astronaut #Spaceflight #Rocket #shelterinplace #dotheshelter #quarantine @lucianohuck @cdcgov @propertybrothers
Cassidy has since traveled to Baikonur Cosmodrome and gone through the regular quarantine procedures. NASA maintains that its employees have been following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for controlling infections ahead of quarantine, “such as cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home and limiting contact with crew members,” according to a NASA spokesperson. Meanwhile, Cassidy and his crewmates have stayed relatively isolated in their hotel, prepping for the mission, exercising, and even playing ping-pong. “Ironically, the timing of our entering the strict quarantine protocol somewhat magically lined up with the world caving in, in terms of quarantine protocol,” Cassidy said.
But come launch day, the sights and sounds leading up to the mission will be much quieter than usual. Roscosmos has banned all media from covering the launch in person, and there will be fewer people on site to cheer the astronauts as they head to the rocket. “Normally as you come walking out of the hotel... there’s music playing and there’s crowds of people lining the walkway as we proceed from the hotel to the buses, and it’s very, very motivating. It’s super exciting,” Cassidy said. But those celebrations will be absent this time around. “It’ll be completely quiet. There won’t be anybody there. We’ll just kind of walk out. Maybe we’ll still play the music and fire the three of us up ourselves. But who knows?”
None of Cassidy’s family or friends can be at the launch due to travel restrictions. His wife was able to be with him while in Star City, and she had planned to attend the launch. But after Russia restricted foreign travel on March 16th, her itinerary changed. Ultimately, she went home when he headed to Baikonur Cosmodrome. “We thought we would say goodbye on launch day,” Cassidy said.
Despite everything, Cassidy is feeling good ahead of launch. He even shared a rap his friend made on Instagram about how to stay at home to fight COVID-19. He hopes that all of the extra precautions were enough to prevent COVID-19’s spread to space. “I really haven’t been around anybody else, so it’d be really, really strange if I did contract something,” Cassidy said on March 19th. “Anything can happen between now and April 9th, but we’re being really super vigilant so that I can remain healthy to get to the station.”
While on board the ISS, the crew will conduct science experiments and maybe even go on some spacewalks down the line. If all goes according to plan, this crew will likely be an audience to this summer’s most anticipated spaceflight event: the arrival of the first crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. The vehicle, developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, is slated to take off this May, carrying NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the space station. But while there’s plenty to look forward to in space, Cassidy said his mind won’t stray far from what’s happening on the Earth below.
“I’ll have a full plate and my mind will be engaged, but I’m still going to be talking, communicating, emailing with my family and loved ones and friends,” Cassidy said. “I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem. It’s certainly my problem, because my family is living it and my friends and my co-workers are living it in real time.”
Takeoff for the mission is slated for 4:05AM ET on April 9th. After launch, the crew will make four orbits around Earth and arrive at the International Space Station six hours later. NASA’s coverage of the launch will begin at 3AM ET, and coverage of docking will begin at 9:30AM ET.

A tool to edit human genes is nowhere near ready to use for pregnancy— but altering early embryos as part of careful laboratory research should be allowed as scientists and society continue to grapple with the ethical questions surrounding this revolutionary technology, organizers of an international summit concluded Thursday.
""It would be irresponsible"" to edit human sperm, eggs or early embryos in a way that leads to pregnancy, said Nobel laureate David Baltimore of the California Institute of Technology, who chaired the summit.
Tools to precisely edit genes inside living cells, especially a cheap and easy-to-use one called CRISP-Cas9, are transforming biology - and potential treatments created by them promise to do such things as cure sickle-cell anemia or fight HIV and cancer.
But depending on how it's used, it also could alter human heredity - maybe create ""designer babies"" - raising ethical questions that triggered three days of debate by scientists, policymakers and ethicists from 20 countries. This so-called germline editing - manipulating sperm, eggs or early embryos - wouldn't affect just one sick person but his or her descendants.
The question gained urgency after Chinese researchers made the first attempt to alter genes in human embryos, an experiment that showed scientists don't yet know how to do that safely and effectively.
The summit's organizers endorsed treatment-related gene editing research, and said lab research on germline issues ""is clearly needed and should proceed"" with appropriate oversight as international debate continues.
The panel offered what geneticist Eric Lander of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard called ""a framework for deciding if and when"" the reproductive use of gene editing ever moves forward.
""As scientific knowledge advances and societal views evolve, the clinical use of germline editing should be revisited on a regular basis,"" the committee concluded. It urged the sponsors of this week's summit - the scientific academies of the U.S., Britain and China - to create an international forum to help ""establish norms concerning acceptable uses of human germline editing.""
Here are some takeaways from the high-profile summit:
REAL-WORLD USE OF ANY KIND IS YEARS AWAY
First-step testing of an initial gene editing therapy, using older tools, has begun in people.
Sangamo Biosciences is developing an HIV treatment - pulling immune cells from patients' blood, editing a gene that boosts resistance to the virus, and returning those cells. So far, 80 HIV patients have received the therapy in first-stage testing, with good results so far, said Sangamo senior scientist Fyodor Urnov.
Next year, Sangamo plans a clinical trial that takes a next step and injects a gene editing tool directly into the body, an attempt to target hemophilia B, a blood disorder.
""We're at the beginning of this story now,"" cautioned Dr. Adrian Thrasher of University College London, where researchers recently treated a 1-year-old leukemia patient with edited immune cells. ""What we'll see over the next five years or so is increasing clinical trials.""
SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT EDITING HUMAN EMBRYOS
The Chinese attempt used embryos too abnormal to ever have developed into a fetus. The researchers aimed to correct a gene defect that triggers a deadly disease, but only a few embryos were fully corrected and others had alterations in the wrong spots.
But it may be feasible to gene edit sperm-producing cells that in some men don't do their job, something a University of Pittsburgh researcher is exploring.
IT'S NOT TOO EARLY TO DEBATE THE ETHICS
Every day, scientists use gene editing to create animals in the laboratory - they've bred mice, pigs, even monkeys. That means it's technically feasible for humans, too, if scientists learn the necessary steps.
One worry is about fraud - someone promising would-be parents that they could edit embryos before science actually gets there. After all, clinics that promise stem cell ""therapy"" that's really just snake oil already lure desperately sick people.
""The conversation is important now to try and deter people from doing it prematurely,"" said developmental geneticist Robin Lovell-Badge of Britain's Francis Crick Institute.
ETHICAL ARGUMENTS
Critics say changing human inheritance could have consequences not foreseeable for several generations, and would pass genetic alterations to future generations without their consent. A mistake could have irreversible consequences.
""It's a radical rupture with past human practices,"" said Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society.
Then there's the question of what is permissible to alter: Just deleting a gene that causes a devastating disease in a family? Or enhancing future children to be smarter, prettier or more athletic?
""I'm skeptical about the 'Brave New World' scenario,"" said Dr. George Daley of Boston Children's Hospital, noting those enhancements involve more genes than anyone can guess.
But parent demand will drive research to one day end certain inherited diseases in families, Daley said, even though the number that could qualify are very rare.
""We're living in an age when humans have modified just about all aspects of our environment, deliberately or accidentally,"" Lovell-Badge told the summit. ""In this context, it seems worth asking why would we not also want to modify ourselves?""
GLOBAL IMPACT
Other countries are having the same debate about whether to allow germline editing research - but if treatment-related gene editing eventually pans out, another question is how poor countries will afford it.
""Even if gene editing becomes a useful strategy for HIV cure, the cost may make access to such treatments impossible for people living in low-resource countries,"" said Keymanthri Moodley of Stellenbosch University in South Africa.",0

(CNN)It's China's biological Sputnik, launched by a rogue scientist. A Chinese scientist has claimed he has succeeded in editing the genes of twin girls, Lulu and Nana, in a medical first that is shocking -- for its secrecy, its needlessness and what it suggests about the culture of medical research in China.
Since the debut of the biotechnology CRISPR-cas9 in 2012, this day seemed inevitable -- despite endless warnings from bioethicists and a wide variety of scientific bodies. Hours after the announcement that the twins were born ""a few weeks ago"" with modified DNA, the technique's co-creator Feng Zhang called for an immediate halt to such trials.
CRISPR is a kind of search-and-destroy or search-and-replace for the human genome. Normally, RNA molecules, spawned through DNA transcription, serve as the blueprint for proteins. But by pairing RNA with the aid of a DNA cutting enzyme called cas9, the CRISPR technique can snip out a particular DNA sequence, turning off genes or replacing them with other DNA.
And since scientists can easily generate an RNA pair for any sequence of DNA (the underlying biological code in each human cell), CRISPR has the potential to cure countless genetic diseases.
But the CRISPR technique isn't perfect, and in every few hundred cases, in what is referred to as ""off-target events,"" it can edit the wrong portion of DNA, potentially creating unwanted mutations.
Less controversial trials are already underway involving humans after birth. This kind of gene editing revises somatic cells, the kind that are not passed on to our offspring.
But when a scientist edits the genes in an embryo prior to implantation into the womb, the germ line is altered. That means the laboratory edits could be passed along to all subsequent generations springing forth from this individual.
Germline editing is highly controversial but has been theoretically condoned under a range of strict criteria and regulations -- all of which include complete transparency within the experimental trial. (The one exception being the details of identification for the participants, which may be kept secret.)
Which is to say, no one wanted this kind of trial done in secret. But secrecy is exactly what the Chinese scientist appears to have chosen. He did not publicly announce his plans to conduct the trial or allow for the scientific community to debate its merits before announcing his findings this week.
And, in that secrecy, Dr. He Jiankui of Shenzen's Southern University of Science and Technology went forward with an ethically flawed research plan, choosing to edit the gene CCR5, so that it was no longer functional. People without working CCR5 genes are more resistant to HIV infection. The researchers targeted couples in which one partner has HIV, offering the hope they can give birth to an HIV-free and HIV-resistant child.
In the case of the former, it's already possible to prevent HIV transmission via sperm washing and assisted fertilization. And, in the case of the latter, while gene editing might be effective in providing some degree of long-term HIV immunity, this has not been proven in humans yet.
Furthermore, HIV vulnerability isn't a disease state -- it's our normal condition; we're all HIV vulnerable unless we happen to be one of the rare people with a naturally occurring CCR5 mutation. And, frankly, there are simple proven ways to prevent the vast majority of HIV transmission events: safe sex and avoidance of contaminated needles.
Most disturbing, CCR5 makes the children He has edited more prone to dying from the far more common influenza virus.
In a troubling twist, the Associated Press reports that American scientist Michael Deem, a professor of bioengineering at Rice University, appears to have participated in the work. Deem told the Associated Press he was in China when the study's participants consented and that they seemed aware of the risks involved. CNN reached out to Deem for comment, but he did not reply.
American research universities typically demand some level of oversight and awareness of their researchers' activities -- regardless of where in the world they are working. Rice University is now investigating Deem's alleged involvement. Rice's spokesperson told me in an email that ""this work as described in press reports, violates scientific conduct guidelines and is inconsistent with ethical norms of the scientific community and Rice University.""
An American Institutional Review Board, the kind of local body of clinicians, scientists, ethicists, and community members responsible for ensuring human subjects research is sufficiently safe and balances interests of the patient and community, would not have approved this study.
Though the Chinese university has denied knowledge of the study and said it violates their standards and the Chinese government has ordered an investigation into the study, that the work was done in China is hardly surprising (and not only because He himself is Chinese.) Last fall, according to ClinicalTrials.gov, 9 out of the 10 CRISPR trials listed were taking place in China.
Why? It's likely because China has a much more lax regulatory structure than in Europe or the United States, allowing relatively informal hospital ethics committees to approve novel genetic research. In Europe and the United States, multiple layers of national regulators provide checks and balance to highly formalized medical trials -- slowing the research process.
But this lax structure has gotten China into trouble before. In 2015, two of the world's top scientific journals, Nature and Science, both cited ethical objections in rejecting the first paper reporting on genetic editing of a human embryo -- work that took place in China. Protein and Cell, the journal that did publish the study, did so, it claimed, only to ""sound an alarm"" on the scientists who had carried out the study.
It is also dismaying to think an American research professor could have assisted in the project in any capacity.
In a YouTube video, He says that the birth of the world's first IVF child 40 years ago was greeted with a storm of controversy, but that the procedure is now routine, and he expects his announcement to be no different. In truth, there is no parallel. Fertilization of an egg outside the human body carries with it no change to the body of the subsequent child and has no impact on future generations.
But we don't need to imagine future transgressions in order to condemn this action. What kind of human rights violation is it called when ambitious scientists secretly make decisions that alter the human race? Will the Chinese government work to strengthen their regulatory framework to prevent future ethically questionable studies -- rather than just condemning the work of He in this particular incident?
He and Deem should not be rewarded for merely first doing what many others could have done, were it not for their own scruples. Without condemnation, we are giving a license to a gene race, which is far riskier than a space race ever was.",0
268,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/science/space/al-worden-dead.html,"Alfred Worden, 88, Dies; Orbited Moon and Walked in Deep Space
While two Apollo 15 crewmen roamed the lunar surface on a scientific mission, he took valuable photographs from the space capsule.
Alfred M. Worden, who orbited the moon in the summer of 1971, taking sophisticated photographs of the lunar terrain while his fellow astronauts of the Apollo 15 mission roamed its surface in a newly developed four-wheel rover, died overnight at an assisted living center in Sugar Land, Texas, his family said on Wednesday. He was 88.
His son-in-law Bill Penczak said that Mr. Worden, who had lived in League City, Texas, apparently had a stroke.
Apollo 15 was NASA’s first moon mission devoted mainly to science. The flight of Apollo 11 in July 1969 had fulfilled President John F. Kennedy’s call for America to reach the moon by the end of the 1960s. But the three lunar landings that preceded Apollo 15 had yielded relatively modest insight into the moon’s origin and composition.
Major Worden, of the Air Force, spent three days in orbit operating a pair of cameras in his space capsule Endeavour.
Those photos provided the sharpest images ever taken of the moon, an achievement that led to the mapping of its rugged terrain. Major Worden also operated an extensive package of instruments to enhance knowledge of space and the moon itself.
En route home, he released a “sub-satellite” — carried by Endeavour and weighing about 78 pounds — that was designed to orbit the moon for at least a year and radio back data on its gravitational field and other technical information. It was the first time such a space vehicle had been deployed.
He also undertook the first walk in deep space, spending 38 minutes tethered to Endeavour while more than 196,000 miles from Earth as he retrieved canisters of film attached to the skin of the craft.
The other Apollo 15 crewmen — Col. David R. Scott and Lt. Col. James B. Irwin, also Air Force officers — became the seventh and eighth men to land on the moon, having descended in their Lunar Module, Falcon, from the space capsule piloted by Major Worden. They spent 18½ hours exploring its surface and covered about 17½ miles in their rover — both NASA records — and returned to the capsule for the flight home with some 170 pounds of rock and soil samples.
The mission was pronounced a success, but NASA later reprimanded the three astronauts for “poor judgment” by seeking to profit from their fame.
They had carried aboard the Apollo 15 craft several hundred specially stamped, signed and canceled envelopes commemorating the flight and sought to sell them through a West German stamp dealer. Under the deal, a total of $21,000 was to be set aside for trust funds to benefit the astronauts’ children, but any proceeds the astronauts themselves would receive were to be deferred, since they were still in the Apollo program.
The deal became public, and while the astronauts withdrew from it, with no funds going to them or their children, NASA was embarrassed and dropped all three from flight status. Major Worden and Colonel Scott were reassigned to desk jobs. Colonel Irwin had already planned to retire.
In July 1983, responding to a lawsuit filed by Mr. Worden, the federal government returned 359 stamped envelopes that NASA had seized from the astronauts, concluding that the space agency had either authorized their being brought aboard the Apollo 15 spacecraft or had known that they were taken on the flight.
But Mr. Worden was remorseful.
“No one was really supposed to arrange to make money from the program while they were still in,” he wrote in his memoir “Falling to Earth” (2011, with Francis French). “Even if I didn’t break any formal rules, in hindsight I had broken an unspoken trust.”
Alfred Merrill Worden was born on Feb. 7, 1932, outside Jackson, Mich., and grew up on a 10-acre farm that yielded little profit for his parents, Merrill and Helen Worden. One of six children, he took on many farm chores as he grew older but saw no future in that line of work.
“I was going to do anything I could so that I didn’t end up living the rest of my life on a farm,” he told Smithsonian Magazine in 2011. “So that kind of motivated me to go to school.”
He received a one-year scholarship to the University of Michigan, but when his funding ran out he applied to Annapolis and West Point, having learned that they provided free educations. He chose the United States Military Academy, graduated in 1955, then joined the Air Force, believing it offered faster promotions than were likely in the Army.
“My total time piloting an airplane at that moment? Zero,” he recalled in his memoir. “For all I knew, I was going to be the worst pilot the Air Force had ever attempted to train.”
He graduated from flight school despite his trepidation, piloted fighter jets stateside, then obtained master’s degrees in space science and engineering from Michigan in 1963. He became a test pilot and instructor afterward, then joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 1966.
He was a senior executive at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California from 1972 to 1975, then retired from the space agency and the Air Force and held executive positions in the aerospace industry.
Mr. Worden is survived by his daughters Alison Penczak and Merrill Bohaning, both from his first marriage, to Pamela Ellen Vander Beek, which ended in divorce; a stepdaughter, Tamara Christians, from his marriage to Jill Lee Hotchkiss, who died in 2014; his brothers Jim and Jerry; his sisters Sally and Carolyn; and five grandchildren.
During the run-up to Apollo 15 as well as after the mission, Mr. Worden sought to enhance youngsters’ curiosity about space by filming segments for the PBS children’s program “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” He wrote the children’s book “I Want to Know About a Flight to the Moon” (1974).
He was a technical consultant for the 2018 movie “First Man,” in which Ryan Gosling portrayed Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step onto the moon.
Mr. Worden also published a book of poetry in 1974, “Hello Earth: Greetings From Endeavour,” reflecting on his emotions during the flight of Apollo 15 and on the perils of spaceflight.
As he put it in one verse:
Say to me there’s too much danger
Say to me we could be lost.
Then I say I am no stranger
To the danger, that’s the cost.",1
269,http://www.reuters.com/article/space-orbital-launch-idUSL1N0TU00U20141210,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec 9 (Reuters) - Sidelined by a rocket explosion in October, Orbital Sciences will buy a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 booster to launch its next International Space Station cargo ship for NASA, officials said on Tuesday.
Orbital’s fifth Antares rocket launch ended 15 seconds after liftoff from Wallops Island, Virginia, on Oct. 28 due to a problem with the booster’s refurbished Soviet-era engine. The accident claimed an unmanned Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of cargo for the space station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth.
Orbital announced last month it would speed up development of a previously planned Antares engine replacement and buy one or two rocket rides from another company to fulfill its contractual obligations to NASA.
Orbital said Tuesday it had selected United Launch Alliance’s Atlas 5 rocket to fly one Cygnus cargo ship in late 2015 and possibly a second freighter in 2016 if needed. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. United Launch Alliance is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
“In formulating its go-forward plans, the company’s primary objective is to fulfill its commitment to NASA for ISS cargo deliveries with high levels of safety and reliability and minimum disruption to schedules,” the company said in a statement.
Orbital is one of two firms hired by the U.S. space agency to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. Orbital and privately owned Space Exploration Technologies each plan to deliver about 40,000 pounds of cargo under contracts worth $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion respectively.
Meanwhile, repairs to Antares launch pad and nearby facilities at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia are expected to take about a year, with recertification targeted by the end of 2015, Orbital said.
Three Cygnus cargo ships will be launched from Virginia in 2016 on Orbital’s revamped Antares rocket. The company has not yet announced what engine will replace the troubled AJ-26, a Soviet-era motor that was purchased, refurbished and resold by GenCorp Inc’s Aerojet Rocketdyne division. A faulty turbopump is believed to be the cause of the Oct. 28 Antares explosion.",1
270,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181681/nasa-human-spaceflight-soyuz-rocket-launch-iss-spacex-coronavirus,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, NASA is still moving forward with many of its upcoming missions, including some launches that will send humans to the International Space Station in the near future. As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.
NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers — Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center — are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows “mission-essential” personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.
NASA’s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency’s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. “The health and safety of NASA’s workforce is the agency’s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,” a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.
But as more workers at JSC stay home, they’re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they’ll join three people already in orbit.
That launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn’t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country’s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.
Of course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don’t know that they’re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called “health stabilization,” according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it “will continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners” if needed.
In the meantime, Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.
Once this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.
However, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA’s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.
SpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company’s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX’s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company’s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.
Of course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe’s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.
It’s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action.",1
271,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-china-babies-panel/proud-chinese-geneticist-says-another-baby-gene-editing-volunteer-pregnant-idUSKCN1NX0EM?feedType=RSS&feedName;=scienceNews,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist at the center of an ethical storm over what he claims are the world’s first genetically edited babies said on Wednesday he is proud of his work and revealed there was a second “potential” pregnancy as part of the research.
He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
“For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,” He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.
Asked whether there were any other edited gene pregnancies as part of his trials, He said there was another “potential” pregnancy and replied “yes” to a follow-up question as to whether it was a “chemical pregnancy”, which refers to an early-stage miscarriage.
It was unclear whether the pregnancy had ended or not.
He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.
“This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,” He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organizers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.
(Graphic explaining CRISPR gene editing technique, tmsnrt.rs/2ReKG1R)
The Chinese Society for Cell Biology in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes and said that it was against the law and medical ethics of China.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. “Pandora’s box has been opened,” they said.
INFORMED CONSENT
He, who said he was against gene enhancement, said eight couples were initially enrolled for his study while one dropped out. The criteria required the father to be HIV positive and the mother to be HIV negative.
Scientists at the conference pressed He to prove that those taking part in the trial were aware of all the risks involved in the process.
He said that all the participants had a “good education background” and went through two rounds of discussions with him and his team.
A 23-page English translation of an informed consent form for the potential mother said that the costs of the procedure covered by the team would be up to 280,000 yuan ($40,200) per couple.
The consent form mentions multiple risks, but there is little detail on potential complications of the gene-editing process itself, including for the child. It does not mention that such an experiment has never been done before.
David Baltimore, President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, spoke after He’s speech, saying it was irresponsible to have proceeded until safety issues were in order.
“I don’t think it has been a transparent process. Only found out about it after it happened and the children were born,” Baltimore said.
He Jiankui said his results could be used for millions of people with inherited diseases. He said he would monitor the two newborns for the next 18 years and hoped they would support continued monitoring thereafter.
Shenzhen Harmonicare Medical Holdings Limited 1509.HK, named as being involved in He's project in China's clinical trial registry, sought to distance itself by stating the hospital never participated in any operations relating to the gene-edited babies and no related delivery had taken place.
In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, the group said preliminary investigations indicated the signatures on the application form circulated on the internet are “suspected to have been forged, and no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”.
The Guangdong province Health Commission announced on its website on Wednesday that it and Shenzhen city had set up a joint team to investigate the case.

272,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12025316/Humans-will-be-irrevocably-altered-by-genetic-editing-warn-scientists-ahead-of-summit.html,"British scientists are among 150 experts calling for a worldwide ban on the genetic editing of embryos claiming the practice would ‘irrevocably alter the human species.’
Hundreds of geneticists are meeting in Washington this week to discuss whether there should be a global moratorium on engineering the DNA of humans if it means that genetic changes would be passed on to future generations.
Experts from Kings College London, Newcastle University and the University of London have joined with lawyers, sociologists and campaigners to call for an urgent ban on the practice warning it will lead to ‘designer babies’ and ‘GM humans.’
However other scientists claim that prohibiting research will only drive the practice underground to ‘black markets and uncontrolled medical tourism.’
In April China was ordered to ‘rein in’ scientists who altered the DNA of embryos to modify the gene responsible for the fatal blood disorder thalassaemia. The Francis Crick Institute in London is also currently seeking permission from the Human Fertilisation and Embyrology Authority (HFEA) to carry out similar experiments in Britain although the embryos will not be implanted in humans.
In an open letter, scientists said there was ‘no justification’ for genetically modifying humans and claimed it could lead to a world where inequality and discrimination were ‘inscribed onto the human genome.’
Among them are Dr Michael Antoniou, Head of the Gene Expression and Therapy Group at Kings College London and Professor Donna Dickinson, emeritus professor of medical ethics at the University of London.
“Permitting germline intervention for any intended purpose would open the door to an era of high-tech consumer eugenics in which affluent parents seek to choose socially preferred qualities for their children,” they write.
“The implementation of heritable human genetic modification could irrevocably alter the nature of the human species and society.
“Experiments could lead to miscarriage, maternal injury and stillbirth. Genetically modified children who seem healthy at bird could develop serious problems later in life. We must not engineer the genes we pass on to our descendants.”
Gene therapy has been available since the 1970s but it is only recently that scientists have developed technology which can snip out parts of genetic code.
While the technique could permanently remove harmful mutations which lead to inherited diseases like Huntingdon’s, cystic fibrosis and haemophilia, critics say it could have unexpected side effects any may damage healthy strands of DNA.
However many scientists have resisted calls for an outright ban because they fear it will drive the practice underground.
Professor George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who helped develop some of the first genetic editing techniques said it would be naive to think a veto would stop unethical experiments.
“To think that there is not already a cadre of IVF clinicians poised to engage in such practices, perhaps even supported by governments, is to ignore, for example, the history of doping in sport,” he told the journal Nature Communications.
British scientists also argued that a global moratorium would do more harm than good, and said that tough regulation and transparency were the best methods of preventing unethical experimentation.
Shirley Hodgson, Emeritus professor of Cancer Genetics, St George's University of London said: “I think a worldwide ban on gene editing is not possible, since the horse has bolted.
“It would not be a good idea to impose a moratorium on this technique, since it is a really important and useful new technique with many possibilities for improving many aspects of medical practice such as cancer treatments.
“A ban would either prevent important research in this area or drive it underground.”
Darren Griffin, Professor of Genetics at the University of Kent added: “I think there needs to be less haste and more research and an agreement that we don’t do it on humans for now until we get a better idea of the outcome.
“But if make a worldwide ban then you really do risk driving the whole thing underground. We need a set of guidelines which say, ‘let’s not do it on the human germline, but let’s do some regulated research. That will also give the social scientists an lawyers time to catch up.”
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act banned germline editing in 1990 but since then parliament has given the go ahead for babies to be created from the DNA of three people, to repair genetic faults. The first ‘three parent babies’ are likely to be born next year and the changes in their DNA will be passed on to their own children, placing germline editing in a legal grey area.
Alastair Kent, Director of the Genetic Alliance said gene editing was a ‘powerful tool’ that needed to be developed in a ‘transparent’ and ‘publically acceptable’ way.
“Banning would simply drive it to those parts of the world where science is already poorly regulated,” he said.
“I don't think a worldwide ban is either desirable or practical.”
Bruce Whitelaw, Professor of Animal Biotechnology at The Roslin Institute in Edinburgh called for extensive debate before editing the human germline was allowed.
""Such use must be regulated and such projects be scrutinised before progressing,"" he said ""However I am not convinced a moratorium is the best way forward as this would stifle the opportunity to use this powerful molecular tool to investigate the early molecular events of human embryo development. I am also not convinced such a moratorium would be practical.""",0
273,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-babies/chinese-scientist-who-gene-edited-babies-fired-by-university-idUSKCN1PF0RA?feedType=RSS&feedName;=worldNews,"SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist who created what he said were the world’s first “gene-edited” babies evaded oversight and broke ethical boundaries in a quest for fame and fortune, state media said on Monday, as his former university said he had been fired.
He Jiankui said in November that he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born that month, sparking an international outcry about the ethics and safety of such research.
Hundreds of Chinese and international scientists condemned He and said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was unethical.
Chinese authorities also denounced He and issued a temporary halt to research activities involving the editing of human genes.
He had “deliberately evaded oversight” with the intent of creating a gene-edited baby “for the purpose of reproduction”, according to the initial findings of an investigating team set up by the Health Commission of China in southern Guangdong province, Xinhua news agency reported.
He had raised funds himself and privately organized a team of people to carry out the procedure in order to “seek personal fame and profit”, Xinhua said, adding that he had forged ethical review papers in order to enlist volunteers for the procedure.
The safety and efficacy of the technologies He used are unreliable and creating gene-edited babies for reproduction is banned by national decree, the report said.
The Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in the city of Shenzhen, said in a statement on its website that He had been fired.
“Effective immediately, SUSTech will rescind the work contract with Dr. Jiankui He and terminate any of his teaching and research activities at SUSTech,” the statement said.
The university added the decision came after a preliminary investigation by the Guangdong Province Investigation Task Force.
Neither He nor a representative could be reached for comment on Monday. He defended his actions at a conference in Hong Kong in November, saying that he was “proud” of what he had done and that gene editing would help protect the girls from being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
International experts in genetic science said they hoped that Monday’s report was only the initial result of investigations into He and that more action would be taken.
“The report will hopefully set an example with appropriate legal and punitive actions to reassure the public and scientific community,” said Yalda Jamshidi, a genomics expert at Britain’s University of London.
He’s announcement sparked a debate among Chinese legal scholars over which laws He had technically broken by carrying out the procedure, as well as whether he could be held criminally responsible or not.
Many scholars pointed to a 2003 guideline that bans altered human embryos from being implanted for the purpose of reproduction, and says altered embryos cannot be developed for more than 14 days.
The case files of those involved who are suspected of committing crimes have been sent to the ministry of public security, an unnamed spokesperson for the investigation team was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
Helen O’Neill, a reproductive science expert at University College London, said she was concerned that the report gave “no further clarification on what measures will be taken to prevent this happening in future, nor what will be done as punishment”.

Conspiracy theories alleging leak was act of sabotage have spread online
Nasa has responded to speculation about the creation of a small hole discovered on the International Space Station (ISS) by saying that it was “not necessarily” created “intentionally or with malintent”.
The 2mm hole was discovered in a Soyuz capsule on the ISS on 29 August, after it caused a leak leading to a small drop in cabin pressure.
Makeshift repairs carried out by the crew slowed the leak, after they taped over the hole and then used sealant on a cloth to plug it temporarily.
The hole has now been fixed, Nasa said in a statement.
Astronauts first suggested that the gap was caused by a small rock that hit the space station.
But the head of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, rejected the theory.
""We are considering all the theories,” Dmitry Rogozin told Russian news agency TASS. “The one about a meteorite impact has been rejected because the spaceship’s hull was evidently impacted from inside.
“But, it seems to be done by a faltering hand … it is a technological error by a specialist. It was done by a human hand – there are traces of a drill sliding along the surface. We don’t reject any theories.”

Conspiracy theories are spreading online and in the Russian media, alleging that a Nasa astronaut may have created the hole.
Nasa has now been forced to respond to mounting speculation the leak could have been an act of sabotage.
“Russian media recently reported that General Director Rogozin said the hole was not a manufacturing defect,” the organisation said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
“Ruling out a manufacturing defect indicates that this is an isolated issue which does not categorically affect future production.
“This conclusion does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally.”
The ISS programme is “tentatively” planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information, the statement added.

276,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-china-babies-panel/chinese-geneticist-feels-proud-of-baby-gene-editing-idUSKCN1NX0EM?feedType=RSS&feedName;=scienceNews,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese scientist at the center of an ethical storm over what he claims are the world’s first genetically edited babies said on Wednesday he is proud of his work and revealed there was a second “potential” pregnancy as part of the research.
He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.
“For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest,” He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.
Asked whether there were any other edited gene pregnancies as part of his trials, He said there was another “potential” pregnancy and replied “yes” to a follow-up question as to whether it was a “chemical pregnancy”, which refers to an early-stage miscarriage.
It was unclear whether the pregnancy had ended or not.
He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.
“This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review,” He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.
In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.
He said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged.
The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organizers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.

The Chinese Society for Cell Biology in a statement on Tuesday strongly condemned any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes and said that it was against the law and medical ethics of China.
More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. “Pandora’s box has been opened,” they said.
INFORMED CONSENT
He, who said he was against gene enhancement, said eight couples were initially enrolled for his study while one dropped out. The criteria required the father to be HIV positive and the mother to be HIV negative.
Scientists at the conference pressed He to prove that those taking part in the trial were aware of all the risks involved in the process.
He said that all the participants had a “good education background” and went through two rounds of discussions with him and his team.
A 23-page English translation of an informed consent form for the potential mother said that the costs of the procedure covered by the team would be up to 280,000 yuan ($40,200) per couple.
The consent form mentions multiple risks, but there is little detail on potential complications of the gene-editing process itself, including for the child. It does not mention that such an experiment has never been done before.
David Baltimore, President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology, spoke after He’s speech, saying it was irresponsible to have proceeded until safety issues were in order.
“I don’t think it has been a transparent process. Only found out about it after it happened and the children were born,” Baltimore said.
He Jiankui said his results could be used for millions of people with inherited diseases. He said he would monitor the two newborns for the next 18 years and hoped they would support continued monitoring thereafter.
Shenzhen Harmonicare Medical Holdings Limited 1509.HK, named as being involved in He's project in China's clinical trial registry, sought to distance itself by stating the hospital never participated in any operations relating to the gene-edited babies and no related delivery had taken place.
In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday, the group said preliminary investigations indicated the signatures on the application form circulated on the internet are “suspected to have been forged, and no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place”.
The Guangdong province Health Commission announced on its website on Wednesday that it and Shenzhen city had set up a joint team to investigate the case.

- Published
Record-breaking astronaut Peggy Whitson has blasted off into space for her third mission to the International Space Station - and hopes to break some more records while she's there.
The veteran Nasa astronaut is the first woman to have commanded the ISS and already holds the record for the longest time spent in space by a woman.
This time - turning 57 while on mission - she is the oldest woman in space.
She blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Friday.
On board the Soyuz rocket with her are Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky and French newcomer Thomas Pesquet.
They are expected to arrive at the ISS on Saturday, joining an American and two Russians already aboard. They will carry out a range of scientific investigations until May 2017.
Iowa-born Peggy Whitson, who has an advanced degree in biochemistry, worked for Nasa in several prominent medical science and research positions before being selected, in 1996, as an astronaut candidate.
She first went into space in 2002 and became the first woman to command the ISS in 2007. She will break records again when she takes charge of the orbiting lab for a second time in February.
By the time her mission ends, she will have spent more time in space than any other US astronaut, surpassing the 534-day record set by Jeff Williams.
""The most important thing about the station is the friendships and the work we accomplish there,"" she told a news conference before the launch at 02:20 local time on Friday morning (20:20 GMT on Thursday).",1
278,http://www.reuters.com/article/space-nasa-launch-idUSL2N0TN1SN20141203,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Dec 3 (Reuters) - A new U.S. spaceship designed to fly astronauts to Mars and other deep space destinations is poised to blast off on an unmanned test flight on Thursday.
A triple-booster Delta 4 Heavy rocket, built and flown by the Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co joint venture known as United Launch Alliance, was cleared for its planned launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 7:05 a.m. EST (1205 GMT) Thursday, NASA said on Wednesday.
Perched atop the rocket, the biggest in the U.S. fleet, is NASA’S first Orion space capsule. It is due to make a 4-1/2-hour flight to test its heat shield, parachutes and other systems needed to ferry astronauts into deep space and return them safely to Earth.
Meteorologists predicted a 70 percent chance the weather will be acceptable for liftoff on a launch that is part of the U.S. space agency’s plan to land humans on an asteroid sometime around 2025 and on Mars about a decade later.
“Tomorrow is a giant day,” NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden told reporters at the launch pad on Wednesday. “For the first time in more than 40 years this nation is going to launch a spacecraft intended to carry humans beyond low-Earth orbit. That’s a big deal.”
NASA’s last human expedition beyond Earth was the final Apollo mission to the moon in 1972.
Flying the capsule without a crew allows NASA to aggressively test how well it fares beyond the protective environment of Earth’s magnetic field and during a 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h) dive back into the atmosphere.
The rocket will take Orion about 3,600 miles (5,800 km) into space, some 15 times farther than where the International Space Station flies, before it plunges back to Earth.
Key events, such as the jettisoning of aerodynamic panels and launch escape system and the deployment of parachutes, will be immediately apparent. How Orion weathers other aspects of the flight will not be known until engineers retrieve recorded data from more than 1,200 sensors aboard the ship.
If all goes as planned, Orion, built by Lockheed Martin, will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. Two U.S. Navy ships and other vessels will be standing by to retrieve the capsule. (Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Tom Brown)",1

He Jiankui’s work was also carried out on a third infant, according to China’s state media, in a new disclosure that is likely to add to the global uproar over such experiments.
BEIJING — A court in China on Monday sentenced He Jiankui, the researcher who shocked the global scientific community when he claimed that he had created the world’s first genetically edited babies, to three years in prison for carrying out “illegal medical practices.”
In a surprise announcement from a trial that was closed to the public, the court in the southern city of Shenzhen found Dr. He guilty of forging approval documents from ethics review boards to recruit couples in which the man had H.I.V. and the woman did not, Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reported. Dr. He had said he was trying to prevent H.I.V. infections in newborns, but the state media on Monday said he deceived the subjects and the medical authorities alike.
Dr. He, 35, sent the scientific world into an uproar last year when he announced at a conference in Hong Kong that he had created the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls. On Monday, China’s state media said his work had resulted in a third genetically edited baby, who had been previously undisclosed.
Dr. He pleaded guilty and was also fined $430,000, according to Xinhua. In a brief trial, the court also handed down prison sentences to two other scientists who it said had “conspired” with him: Zhang Renli, who was sentenced to two years in prison, and Qin Jinzhou, who got a suspended sentence of one and a half years.
The court held that the defendants, “in the pursuit of fame and profit, deliberately violated the relevant national regulations on scientific and medical research and crossed the bottom line on scientific and medical ethics,” Xinhua said.
Dr. He’s declaration made him a pariah among scientists, cast a harsh light on China’s scientific ambitions and embroiled other scientists in the United States who were connected to Dr. He. Though Dr. He offered no proof and did not share any evidence or data that definitively proved he had done it, his colleagues had said it was possible that he had succeeded.
American scientists who knew of Dr. He’s plans came under scrutiny. Dr. He’s former academic adviser, Stephen Quake, a star Stanford bioengineer and inventor, was cleared of any wrongdoing after an investigation into his interaction with his former student. Rice University has been investigating Michael Deem, Dr. He’s Ph.D. adviser, because of allegations that he was actively involved in the project.
Dr. Quake has said he had nothing to do with Dr. He’s work. Mr. Deem has said he was present for parts of Dr. He’s research but his lawyers have denied that he was actively involved.
During the Hong Kong conference, Dr. He said he used in vitro fertilization to create human embryos that were resistant to H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. He said he did it by using the Crispr-Cas9 editing technique to deliberately disable a gene, known as CCR₅, that is used to make a protein H.I.V. needs to enter cells.
The international condemnation from the scientific community that followed Dr. He’s announcement came because many nations, including the United States, had banned such work, fearing it could be misused to create “designer babies” and alter everything from eye color to I.Q.
Business & Economy: Latest Updates
Although China lacks laws governing gene editing, the practice is opposed by many researchers there. Dr. He’s work prompted soul-searching among the country’s scientists, who wondered whether many of their peers had overlooked ethical issues in the pursuit of scientific achievement.
Many of them said it was long overdue for China to enact tough laws on gene editing. China’s vice minister of science and technology said last year that Dr. He’s scientific activities would be suspended, calling his conduct “shocking and unacceptable.” A group of 122 Chinese scientists called Dr. He’s actions “crazy” and his claims “a huge blow to the global reputation and development of Chinese science.”
“I think a jail sentence is the proper punishment for him,” said Wang Yuedan, a professor of immunology at Peking University. “It makes clear our stance on the gene editing of humans — that we are opposed to it.”
“This is a warning effect, signaling that there is a bottom line that cannot be broken.”
Despite the outcry, Dr. He was unrepentant. A day after he made his announcement on the genetically edited babies, he defended his actions, saying they were safe and ethical, and he was proud of what he had done.
Dr. He faced a maximum penalty of more than 10 years in prison if his work had resulted in death. In cases that have caused “serious damage to the health of the victims,” the punishment is three to 10 years in prison.
The court said the trial had to be closed to the public to guard the privacy of the people involved.
Dr. He’s whereabouts had been something of a mystery for the past year. After his announcement, he was placed under guard in a small university guesthouse in Shenzhen and he has made no statements since. But his conviction was a foregone conclusion after the government said its initial investigation had found that Dr. He had “seriously violated” state regulations.
After Dr. He’s announcement, Bai Hua, the head of Baihualin, an AIDS advocacy group that helped Dr. He recruit the couples, said that he regretted doing so and was deeply worried about the families. In a statement posted on his organization’s official WeChat account, Mr. Bai, who uses a pseudonym, said he felt “deceived.”
When reached by phone, Mr. Bai said he had no idea where the babies were now and declined to say whether he was assisting the government with its investigation.
One H.I.V.-infected man Dr. He’s team tried to recruit said he was not told of the ethical concerns about editing human embryos, according to Sanlian Weekly, a Chinese newsmagazine. The man said a researcher had told him that the probability of his having an unhealthy baby was low and that the team had achieved a high success rate in testing with animals.
The announcement captured the attention of many Chinese people who had not seen or heard from Dr. He in the past year. The hashtag “Sentencing in the Genetically Edited Babies Case” was trending on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.
“He violated medical ethics, disrespected life and let three poor children bear the consequences, all for his fame and fortune,” one user wrote. “I think this punishment is too light.”

281,https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/nasa-suspends-work-on-its-moon-and-mars-spacecraft-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/,"NASA has temporarily paused work on the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion capsule that will be used for its forthcoming Artemis missions, which will ultimately return the next American man and the first American woman to the surface of the Moon. The rocket and spacecraft were undergoing production and testing activities ahead of the first Artemis mission, which had been planned for no earlier than April 2021.
This move comes as a result of NASA moving its Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, and its Stennis Space Center location in Mississippi to what it terms “Stage 4” of the agency’s four-stage “NASA Response Framework.” This is an emergency preparedness scale that NASA has in place as guidance for its response to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and it defines what actions the agency will take in terms of its staff and facilities at each of its physical sites depending on how the outbreak unfolds.
Stage 4 is the highest level in the framework, and imposes the most stringent restrictions. These include mandatory telework for all staff, as well as full closure of the physical facilities themselves, except “to protect life and critical infrastructure.” Employees can still meet and hold events, but strictly in a virtual capacity. Fully remote work is obviously not compatible with either building out a rocket, or performing key final checks on a spacecraft designed to eventually carry humans.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has been issuing daily updates about the status of the agency’s facilities and working conditions relative to the framework. All facilities have been escalated to Stage 3, which encourages mandatory telework but keeps doors open on facilities for mission-critical personnel only. Stage 4 has been instituted at specific facilities due either to personnel contracting the virus or to local “shelter-in-place” orders or high concentration of cases.
Bridenstine says that the facilities where the SLS and Orion are being worked on will be locked down and secured to make sure that everything is in a safe condition for the suspension and ready for resumption of work once the Stage 4 condition is lifted. This will also result in “impacts to NASA missions,” he notes in the update, which sounds like an acknowledgement that dates will slip for the existing proposed Artemis missions timeline.",1
282,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/4/scientists-urge-caution-on-human-gene-editing.html,"An international group of scientists and ethicists said this week that it would be “irresponsible” to use a powerful tool for editing human genes until more is known about the consequences and ethics of passing genetic changes to future generations.
At the close of the three-day International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Washington, D.C., participants urged caution in moving forward with “any clinical use” of human gene editing — “unless and until the relevant safety and efficacy issues have been resolved” and “broad societal consensus” is reached on the issue. They also said the practice should take place only under “appropriate regulatory oversight.”
Tools to precisely edit genes inside living cells, especially a cheap and easy-to-use mechanism called CRISP-Cas9, are transforming biology. Potential treatments include a possible cure for sickle-cell anemia, and new ways to fight HIV and cancer. But this so-called germline editing — which can involve manipulating sperm, eggs or embryos — wouldn’t affect only a patient, but also his or her descendants.
And depending on how gene editing is used, it also could alter human heredity — possibly to create ""designer babies"" — raising ethical questions that triggered three days of debate among the scientists, policymakers and ethicists from 20 countries at the Washington summit.
The question gained urgency after Chinese researchers in April made the first attempt to alter genes in human embryos, an experiment that showed scientists don't yet know how to do that safely and effectively.
The Washington summit's participants endorsed treatment-related gene editing research, and said laboratory research on germline editing ""is clearly needed and should proceed"" with appropriate oversight as international debate continues.
A panel of participants at the Washington summit offered what geneticist Eric Lander of the Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard called ""a framework for deciding if and when"" the reproductive use of gene editing ever moves forward.
""As scientific knowledge advances and societal views evolve, the clinical use of germline editing should be revisited on a regular basis,"" the panel concluded. It urged the sponsors of this week's summit — scientific academies of the United States, Britain and China — to create an international forum to help ""establish norms concerning acceptable uses of human germline editing.""
First-step testing of an initial gene editing therapy, using older tools, has already begun in people.
Sangamo Biosciences of Richmond, California, is developing an HIV treatment that involves pulling immune cells from patients' blood, editing a gene that boosts resistance to the virus, and then returning those cells to the bloodstream. So far 80 HIV patients have received the therapy in first-stage testing, with good results so far, said Sangamo senior scientist Fyodor Urnov.
Next year, Sangamo plans a clinical trial that would take step further and inject a gene editing tool directly into the body in an attempt to target hemophilia B, a blood disorder.
""We're at the beginning of this story now,"" cautioned Dr. Adrian Thrasher of University College London, where researchers recently used edited immune cells to treat a 1-year-old leukemia patient. ""What we'll see over the next five years or so is increasing clinical trials.""
The Chinese attempt used embryos too abnormal to ever have developed into fetuses. The researchers aimed to correct a gene defect that triggers a deadly disease, but only a few embryos were fully corrected and others had alterations in the wrong spots.
Critics say changing human inheritance could have consequences not foreseeable for several generations, and could pass genetic alterations to descendants without their consent. A mistake could have irreversible consequences.
""It's a radical rupture with past human practices,"" said Marcy Darnovsky of the Center for Genetics and Society, a nonprofit based in Berkeley, California.
There is also the question of what is permissible to alter, whether it’s just deleting a gene that causes a devastating disease in a family, or enhancing future children to be smarter, more attractive or more athletic.
""I'm skeptical about the 'Brave New World' scenario,"" said Dr. George Daley of Boston Children's Hospital, noting that such enhancements involve more genes than anyone can guess.
One of the scientists who discovered powerful tools for altering genes is not convinced that the case has been made for using the technology on human sperm, eggs and embryos.
""The tools are not ready,"" biologist Emmanuelle Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin and Umea University, Sweden, told Reuters on Wednesday during the Washington summit.
""As long as they are not perfect and ready, I think it's good to have this ban against editing the germline,” Charpentier said.
Charpentier and colleague Jennifer Doudna of the University of California at Berkeley did pioneering work on developing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a technology that can strategically delete specific stretches of DNA and add in genes.
She said she would need very strong convincing about the immediate benefits of editing human germline cells. ""For the moment,” she said, “I don't see any.""

283,https://www.france24.com/en/20190411-nasas-twins-study-landmark-research-us-astronauts,"What if you could send an astronaut into space for a year and monitor him closely along with his identical twin brother on Earth?
The US space agency NASA did just that and published the findings on Thursday of a landmark study that could provide insights into the hazards of long space flights such as a mission to Mars.
The researchers found that most of the changes to the human body from extended spaceflight returned to normal shortly after a return to Earth.
Dr. Susan Bailey of Colorado State University said the study is the ""most comprehensive view that we've ever had of the response of the human body to space flight.""
The ""NASA Twins Study,"" published in the journal Science, monitored US astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent a year on the International Space Station, and his earthbound identical twin Mark Kelly, also a former astronaut.
Using Mark as a baseline, the 84 researchers at 12 universities documented the molecular, cognitive and physiological effects of Scott's year in space.
""There are thousands of gene and molecular changes that occur as someone goes in space,"" said Dr Michael Snyder of Stanford University.
""Virtually all of those returned to normal by six months,"" Snyder said. ""It's reassuring to know that when you come back things will largely be back to the same.""
Bill Paloski, director of NASA's Human Research Program, said the study will help understand the challenges of interplanetary missions such as a two- or three-year journey to Mars.
Scott, a 50-year-old veteran of two US Space Shuttle missions, spent 340 consecutive days on the ISS -- from March 27, 2015 to March 1, 2016.
He was monitored pre-flight and post-flight and during his time on the ISS. Blood, urine and stool samples were sent back to Earth on resupply vessels.
At the same time, scientists monitored Mark -- a veteran himself of four Space Shuttle missions -- on Earth as what they called a ""genetically matched ground control.""
""The unique thing is that because they're twins, essentially they have the same genetic code,"" said Dr. Andy Feinberg of Johns Hopkins University.
- Weight loss -
Dr. Stuart Lee of NASA's Johnson Space Center said measurements were taken of the thickness in both Scott and Mark of the carotid artery wall, which can be an indicator of cardiovascular disease or stroke risk.
""Our main findings in Scott were that the carotid artery wall became thicker early in flight and remained so throughout the mission,"" Lee said.
Mark did not have any such thickening.
Thickening of the carotid artery wall has been observed in astronauts previously.
So has weight loss due to poorer nutrition in space and a lack of exercise.
Scott lost seven percent of his body mass during his time on the ISS while Mark gained about four percent during the course of the study.
In one test, both Scott and Mark were administered a flu vaccination. It delivered a similar immune response.
The twins also performed a battery of cognitive tests before, during and after the flight and found that Scott's cognitive performance declined post-flight in terms of speed and accuracy.
Chris Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medicine, looked at how the unique environment of space impacts genes.
""We catalogued basically what is the landscape of all these genes that have gone up and gone down at different stages during the mission,"" Mason said.
""We saw that the vast majority, over 90 percent of all these changes, all returned back to baseline coming back to Earth,"" Mason said.
- Telomere length -
Some of the most interesting research was done by Dr. Bailey's team at Colorado State University which looked at telomeres, the ends of chromosomes that typically shorten as people get older.
Telomeres are considered a biomarker of aging or health risks from cardiovascular disease or cancer.
Bailey's team evaluated Scott and Mark's telomere lengths before the flight and found that they were very similar.
What surprised her team was that Scott experienced a ""specific elongation of telomeres"" during his time on the ISS.
""Scott's telomeres were longer during space flight than they were either before or after,"" Bailey said.
Bailey cautioned that the finding ""can't really be viewed as the fountain of youth and that people might expect to live longer because they're in space.""
She said there was a ""very rapid decrease"" in telomere length upon Scott's return to Earth and he also had some telomere loss.
""Because such metrics can inform overall health, monitoring telomere length dynamics represents an important element of evaluating health and potential long-term risk for future astronauts,"" the study said.
Bailey said her team has not come up with an explanation for the telomere lengthening but was looking at whether the higher radiation exposure in space, inflammation or stress may be responsible.
Feinberg noted some of the logistical challenges of the study.
For his own safety, scientists were only allowed to draw ""less blood from Scott than a child is allowed to have drawn during a hospital stay,"" he said.
On one occasion, supplies for the study being shipped to the ISS were lost when a SpaceX transport rocket blew up.

284,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-genetically-edited-babies-20181126-story.html,"HONG KONG — A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world's first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.
If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.
A U.S. scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.
Many mainstream scientists think it's too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.
The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus.
He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.
There is no independent confirmation of He's claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press.
""I feel a strong responsibility that it's not just to make a first, but also make it an example,"" He told the AP. ""Society will decide what to do next"" in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.
Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.
It's ""unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,"" said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.
""This is far too premature,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. ""We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal.""
However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University's George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called ""a major and growing public health threat.""
""I think this is justifiable,"" Church said of that goal.
In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that's causing problems.
It's only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it's not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.
He Jiankui, who goes by ""JK,"" studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies. The university said He's work ""seriously violated academic ethics and standards"" and planned to investigate. A spokesman for He confirmed that he has been on leave from teaching since early this year, but he remains on the faculty and has a lab at the school.
The U.S. scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called ""a small stake"" in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He's two companies.
The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.
He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.
All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.
Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.
He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym ""Bai Hua,"" told the AP that it's not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.
Here is how He described the work:
The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was ""washed"" to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.
When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.
Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.
Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.
They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.
""It's almost like not editing at all"" if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.
Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered.
""In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you're exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,"" Musunuru said.
The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers' ""main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,"" Church said.
Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it's very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.
There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.
It's unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an ""AIDS vaccine development"" program.
The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he ""absolutely"" thinks they were able to understand the risks.
Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine.
""That might be a layman's way of describing it,"" he said.
Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.
The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they're adults.
Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a ""first"" was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.
He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.
Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants' HIV infection from being disclosed.
""We think this is ethical,"" said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.
Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He's lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.
The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but ""are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it's their life on the line.""
""I believe this is going to help the families and their children,"" He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, ""I would feel the same pain as they do and it's going to be my own responsibility.""

285,http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-dna-gene-editing-20170214-story.html,"To prevent serious medical conditions, scientists should be able to edit people’s DNA, panel says
Scientists should be allowed to alter a person’s DNA in ways that will be passed on to future generations, but only to prevent serious and strongly heritable diseases, according to a new report from the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine.
However, tinkering with these genes in order to enhance or alter traits such as strength, intelligence or beauty should remain off-limits, the report authors concluded.
Changing the so-called germline — effectively, editing humanity’s future by altering genes in human reproductive cells — is illegal in the United States. It has largely been considered ethically off-limits here as well, at least while bioethicists and scientists pondered the unforeseen effects and unexamined moral dilemmas of using new gene-editing technologies.
However, scientists have moved forward aggressively to explore the feasibility of altering disease genes in other adult human cells with a revolutionary technique known as CRISPR-Cas9. It is widely believed that gene editing of this sort could treat patients with metabolic disorders, certain cancers, and a range of other diseases that arise from genetic mutations — without altering the germline.
Last year, Chinese scientists launched a trial that uses CRISPR-Cas9 in a treatment for lung cancer. While the trial’s outcome is awaited with high anticipation, scientists outside of China have expressed concern that ethical reservations in the United States and Europe will put them at a disadvantage.
CRISPR-Cas9 makes gene editing more straightforward, more precise and far more widespread. As such, the National Academies’ report acknowledges that changing heritable DNA in eggs, sperm and early embryos is fast becoming “a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.”
The 22-member panel of scientists and bioethicists who produced the report completed a comprehensive review of the issues raised by that prospect.
Clinical trials involving germline editing should only be pursued to treat diseases that cannot be improved with “reasonable alternatives,” the committee said. In addition, they added, scientists should convincingly demonstrate they are targeting a gene that either causes or strongly predisposes a carrier to a serious disease or condition, and that they have weighed the likely risks and benefits of altering that gene.
These clinical trials should be conducted under public scrutiny that takes into account issues of societal fairness, personal dignity and scientific integrity, the panel said.
Finally, scientists should conduct long-term follow-up studies to discern how gene editing affects subsequent generations. Public debate and discussion about the technology should continue, the panel added.
“Genome editing research is very much an international endeavor, and all nations should ensure that any potential clinical applications reflect societal values and be subject to appropriate oversight and regulation,” said MIT cancer researcher Richard O. Hynes, who co-chaired the panel with University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist R. Alta Charo. “These overarching principles and the responsibilities that flow from them should be reflected in each nation’s scientific community and regulatory processes.”
Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, an immunologist and bioethicist who was not on the panel, said the group “has asked the compelling questions,” sparking a conversation that must keep up with a rapid pace of scientific discovery in this field. He called the report’s release “a fantastic development.”
“What they’re saying is, let’s start the conversation, maintain ethical structures along the way, and hopefully do this the right way,” said Whelan, who serves on the advisory board of USC’s Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies.
The international panel included members from the U.S., China, France, Israel and Italy. Their report was underwritten in part by the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

- UK scientists have edited human embryos for the first time
- A key gene has been identified that helps determine the healthy development of human embryos
(CNN)The DNA of human embryos has been altered and studied for the first time in the UK, offering new insight into the early stages of human development.
Scientists at the Francis Crick Institute, a medical research center, have identified the role of a key gene that controls how embryos form during the first few days of development.
Understanding the biology behind these early stages could help in the discovery of ways to improve the success of in-vitro fertilization, offer some explanation into why some women experience miscarriage and offer general knowledge on how humans develop.
Studies in the United States have manipulated the genomes of embryos to help understand -- and fix -- gene mutations that lead to inherited diseases, such as heart conditions. But this is the first research to target human growth and development.
'Switching off' a crucial stage
Stopping a gene from working and exploring what happens when it's gone is a good way to find out the gene's purpose.
The team used a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 to switch off a particular gene involved in embryo development, known as OCT4. Blocking the functioning of this gene means the resulting protein, also called OCT4, cannot be produced, eventually halting an embryo's development.
When a human egg is fertilized, it forms an embryo, which then divides and grows from one cell into a ball of more than 200 cells, called a blastocyst. At this point, the cells begin to separate and specialize, with some set to form the placenta and others destined to form a baby.
The researchers found that without OCT4, this blastocyst couldn't form.
""We were surprised to see just how crucial this gene is for human embryo development, but we need to continue our work to confirm its role,"" said Norah Fogarty of the Francis Crick Institute, first author of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. ""Other research methods, including studies in mice, suggested a later and more focused role for OCT4, so our results highlight the need for human embryo research,"" she said in a statement.
The new research investigated the role of this gene in mice and humans and found that OCT4 plays a different role in human embryos than in mice, highlighting the need for human research in this area.
""In humans, (OCT4) not only maintains the embryo, but other tissues are affected, and the blastocyst does not form,"" said Ludovic Vallier, a stem cell biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who co-authored the research. ""In mice, (the gene) just maintains the integrity of the embryo.""
Vallier believes this further highlights that human development is very specific and different from that of other species, meaning techniques based on animal models will have limitations. ""We never know what to expect when we model from a mouse system,"" he said.
For the new study, the Crick Institute team blocked the OCT4 gene in 41 embryos donated by couples who had undergone IVF.
Opening the door for further research
After showing that gene-editing techniques can highlight the functionality of certain genes in this way, the team hopes other scientists will use these methods to discover the role of other genes and ultimately help improve IVF and avoid miscarriage.
Among women who know they are pregnant, it's estimated that one on six will have a miscarriage, according to the UK's National Health Service.
""If we knew the key genes that embryos need to develop successfully, we could improve IVF treatments and understand some causes of pregnancy failure,"" Kathy Niakan of the Francis Crick Institute, who led the research, said in a statement. This study opens the door for further investigations.
""It may take many years to achieve such an understanding. Our study is just the first step.""
""This proof-of-principle paper uses CRISPR genome editing to show that although genetic expression in the early mouse embryo may be similar to a human embryo. There are critical differences in the levels and resulting developmental capacity of these embryos when essential genes are mutated,"" said Helen Claire O'Neill, programme director of reproductive science and women's health at University College London, who was not involved in the study. ""This paper therefore elegantly highlights the need for further research using human embryos.""
""One in every four couples has been affected by infertility, and to address the issue, we have to understand the biology of the earliest stages of human development,"" commented Dr. Dusko Ilic, reader in stem cell science at King's College London, who also was not part of the research. ""The study is another proof that the findings from experimental animal models cannot be always extrapolated to humans.""
Ethical questions
This form of research, however, does not come without controversy, as it involved manipulating the genes of human embryos and the potential to alter the germline: how DNA is passed on though generations.
In the UK, strict ethical guidelines are in place for the use of eggs, sperm and embryos in research, regulated by the Human Fertilization and Embryo Authority. Researchers must apply for a license to conduct research, and embryos used for research cannot develop for longer than 14 days after fertilization and cannot be implanted into a woman's womb.
The new study explored blastocyst formation in embryos, which occurs within seven days of fertilization.
The controversy surrounding gene editing in human embryos partly stems from concern that the changes CRISPR makes in DNA can be passed down to the offspring of those embryos, from generation to generation. Down the line, that could affect the genetic makeup of humans in erratic ways.
Some CRISPR critics also have argued that gene editing may give way to eugenics and to allowing embryos to be edited with certain features in order to develop so-called designer babies.
But the researchers believe this does not apply to the current study, which focused on basic science and understanding rather than future editing in humans.
""We are focusing on developing the technology,"" Vallier said. ""These proof-of-concept studies are needed to know the risks, to be sure there are no side effects and that the technique is not damaging other regions of the genome.""
Many experts believe this form of research is pivotal to gaining a better understanding of how humans develop.
""There are many more questions posed by this first demonstration that genome editing can be added to the toolbox of methods that can be used to understand the biology of the early human embryo,"" said Robin Lovell-Badge, a geneticist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the study. ""More understanding of the embryo itself will also lead to better ways to derive and use stem cells corresponding the various cell types that are present in the embryo shortly before implantation. Knowing which genes and the pathways they control will be key to all of this.""",0

By Irene Klotz
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Dec 5 - A U.S. spaceship designed to one day fly astronauts to Mars made a near-bullseye splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on Friday, wrapping up a flawless, unmanned debut test flight around Earth.
“It’s hard to have a better day than today,” NASA’s Orion capsule program manager Mark Geyer told reporters after landing.
The cone-shaped capsule blasted off aboard a Delta 4 Heavy rocket, the biggest in the U.S. fleet, just after dawn from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Three hours later, it reached peak altitude of 3,604 miles (5,800 km) above the planet, a prelude to the most challenging part of the flight, a 20,000-mph (32,000 km/h) dive back to Earth.
Orion survived a searing plunge through the atmosphere, heating up to 4,000 degree Fahrenheit (2,200 degree Celsius) - twice as hot as molten lava - and experiencing gravitational forces eight times stronger than Earth’s.
Over the next few minutes, a total of 11 parachutes deployed to slow Orion’s descent, including three gigantic main chutes that guided the spaceship to a 20-mph (32 km/h) splashdown 630 miles (1,014 km) southwest of San Diego, California, at 11:29 a.m. EST (11:29 EST).
Details of the spaceship’s performance, especially how it weathered surges of radiation as it passed through the lower Van Allen radiation belt, will come after data recorded by more than 1,200 onboard sensors is retrieved and analyzed.
“I’m sure we’re going to find some very interesting things,” Geyer said.
The point of the flight, which cost NASA about $375 million, was to verify that Orion’s 16.5-foot (5-meter) diameter heat shield, parachutes, avionics and other equipment would work as designed prior to astronauts flying aboard.
NASA has been developing Orion, along with a new heavy-lift rocket, for more than eight years. The design of the rocket has changed, leaving Orion sole survivor of the canceled Constellation lunar exploration program to become the centerpiece of a new human space initiative intended to fly crews to Mars.
NASA has spent more than $9 billion developing Orion, which will make a second test flight, also without crew, in about four years.
A third mission, expected around 2021, will include two astronauts on a flight that will send the capsule high around the moon. Since the end of the Apollo moon program in 1972, astronauts have flown only a few hundred miles above Earth.
“We’ve ... finally done something for the first time for our generation. It’s a good day,” said Mike Hawes, Orion program manager with NASA prime contractor Lockheed Martin.
Orion’s debut flight originally had been slated for Thursday but a problem with the rocket, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed and Boeing Co, delayed the launch one day.",1

The Curiosity team began fully remote operations due to the coronavirus in March, according to a release Tuesday from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Headsets and monitors were distributed to employees but some sophisticated hardware, like 3D-imaging goggles used to navigate the rover through the rocky Mars landscape, couldn't be sent home, NASA said. The team resolved the hardware issue by instead using simple red-blue 3D glasses to help plan drives and arm movements.
The team is also relying more heavily on video conferences and messaging apps in order to communicate, NASA said. Normally, the Curiosity team works with hundreds of other scientists around the world. To program an action for the rover alone takes 20 or so scientists, according to NASA.
Regardless of the hurdles, NASA said the Curiosity rover is as productive as ever.
Curiosity is NASA's only functioning rover on Mars at the moment, but it will hopefully soon be joined by Perseverance, which is scheduled to launch in July. Curiosity has been in residence on Mars since 2012 and it continues to seek out signs of ancient microbial life.

A Soyuz rocket carrying Whitson, rookie French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy lifted off from the Russia-leased launch facility in Kazakhstan at 2.20am on Friday (8.20pm GMT on Thursday) and went into orbit eight minutes later.
The crew has now docked at the space station after travelling for two days, where they joined an American and two Russians already on board.
Whitson, who will celebrate her 57th birthday in February while on the ISS, has become the oldest woman to fly into space.
That's a far cry from John Glenn's space shuttle flight at the age of 77, but it is enough to beat the record set by fellow American Barbara Morgan in 2007, who was 55 at the time.
During training, a French documentary crew followed Pesquet, 38, focusing on his relative youth and fresh eyes.
Whitson said the interest in her participation in the mission, by comparison, was for being ""old and experienced"".
""All right, yes, I'm old,"" she said in a Nasa interview. She noted in a series of pre-flight interviews, saying it gets easier with age, knowing what to expect on a space flight and how to prioritise.
This will be the third ISS mission for the Iowa-born biochemist, who first went to space in 2002, and her second stint as commander. In 2007, she became the first woman to command the ISS and will set another first when she will takes the lead for the second time.
Whitson has already spent 377 days in space and logged almost 40 hours of spacewalking. This was the most recorded by a woman until 2012, when compatriot Sunita Williams racked up 50 hours of cumulative spacewalk time.
This six-month mission should also push her beyond 534 days in space, the US record set in September by 58-year-old astronaut Jeffrey Williams.
The trio will carry out a range of scientific investigations on the ISS until May 2017.
Whitson said she's had a lucky run with few regrets. But she told reporters last summer: ""In terms of goals for Nasa before I die, we need to be living on Mars. And I might not live that long, so they better get on with it!""",1

NASA
And today they will enjoy the fruit of their labor: eat the first time a red romaine lettuce called ""Outredgeous"" that's been planted, grown and harvested in space.
The event will be live-streamed on NASA TV today, as part of a six-hour spacewalk by the Russian crew aboard the International Space Station that begins at 9:45 a.m. EDT.
NASA's experiment, called Veg-01, is intended to figure out an effective way to grow plants in-orbit. It uses a technology called ""Veggie,"" which has been jointly developed by NASA and the aerospace research company Orbital Technologies Corporation.
Supplies of fresh food are harder to come by in space, since there aren't enough options for refrigeration. In fact, as soon as fresh food supplies land in space, they get eaten almost immediately. Space missions, on the other hand, are expected to grow longer and longer - think future Mars expeditions. So a simple solution would be to grow your own greens in space to survive the long hauls.
But growing food in orbit is not a cakewalk; it's more of a spacewalk.
There's no gravity, of course, to hold water and soil down. In a weightless environment, roots also tend to grow in odd directions. Moreover, it doesn't rain or shine inside the cold metallic space station.
Enter a special plant growth system that can thrive in zero gravity - imagine an ultramini-greenhouse. The Veggie solves the problem of weightlessness using plant ""pillows,"" which serves as a bed for roots. The lightweight, low-maintenance structure made from special fabrics is filled with soil, fertilizer and seeds. Crew members use a reservoir below the pillow to keep the roots moist.
The shoots emerge to find red and blue LEDs shining overhead. That's the color of lights that plants use for photosynthesis. But since the purplish lights are not too pleasant to look at, green LEDs are turned on. The appearance of the mock garden has psychological benefits too. In the relatively sterile environment of spaceships, gardening perks up astronauts and helps them feel closer to nature.
In case you're wondering how safe the space-grown lettuce is, the pillow is thrown away after it's been used once to keep bacteria away.
The chamber was first brought in the spring of 2014, and the first pillows were installed. After 33 days, the plants were harvested and flown back to Earth to test for food safety. The current Veg-01 pillows were set in motion on July 8 and grew again for 33 days.
And today, the astronauts on board are all excited about tasting their harvest.

292,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-50944461,"China jails 'gene-edited babies' scientist for three years
- Published
A scientist in China who said he had created the world's first gene-edited babies has been jailed for three years.
He Jiankui was convicted of violating a government ban by carrying out his own experiments on human embryos, to try to give them protection against HIV.
He was globally condemned when he announced his experiments, and the birth of twin babies, last November.
Xinhua news agency said a third baby was also born at the same time, which had not previously been confirmed.
The local government in Guangdong province said it was keeping the babies under medical observation.
As well as the prison sentence, He was fined three million yuan ($430,000; £328,000).
The court also handed lower sentences to two men, Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, for conspiring with He to carry out the experiments.
A court in Shenzhen said the men had acted ""in the pursuit of personal fame and gain"", and had seriously ""disrupted medical order"", Xinhua news agency reported.
""They've crossed the bottom line of ethics in scientific research and medical ethics,"" the court added.
What happened last year?
He announced the birth of gene-edited twins called Lula and Nana in a video, filmed by Associated Press, in November 2018.
Describing his experiments, He said: ""I understand my work will be controversial - but I believe families need this technology and I'm willing to take the criticism for them.""
After the video was released, the backlash from the science community both in China and around the world was swift and forceful.
The Chinese government placed He under police investigation and ordered his research work be stopped.
He was also fired by the university where he was an associate professor, the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen.
The Chinese Academy of Science released a statement about He, saying it ""firmly opposed"" gene editing on humans.
""Under current circumstances, gene editing in human embryos still involves various unresolved technical issues, might lead to unforeseen risks, and violates the consensus of the international scientific community,"" the statement added.
How did the experiment work?
He was targeting a gene called CCR5.
This is a set of genetic instructions that are important for a functioning immune system - but they are also the doorway that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) walks through to infect cells.
Mutations to CCR5 essentially lock the door and give people resistance to HIV.
According to South China Morning Post, He recruited seven heterosexual couples who wanted children to take part in the study. The men were all living with HIV, while the women were not.
The professor made embryos in an IVF clinic, and used gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to change the CCR5 gene.
He then forged documents in order to pass a mandatory ethics review, and fabricated information so that medical doctors would unknowingly implant the gene-edited embryos into two women.
What are the repercussions?
The full consequences of gene-editing babies are unclear, but the effects could be permanent.
If the babies grow up to have children of their own, any genetic modifications could be passed down through the generations. This could potentially introduce a lasting change to the human race.
This is even more complicated in the case of He's experiment.
Earlier this month, when He's original research was published for the first time, scientists said the results did not show what He had said they did.
While He had targeted the correct gene, they said, he had not created the exact mutation associated with resistance to HIV.
Instead, He created previously-unseen genetic edits - the effects of which are currently unknown.
Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the UK-based Francis Crick Institute, told BBC News that they ""just can't tell"" what the effects of these edits will be.
""There have never been any studies on these specific mutations because they haven't existed before,"" he said.
""He was very foolish. He thought he knew better, but the techniques are just not there yet to do [genome editing] safely and efficiently.""
The long-term effects remain to be seen - but, Prof Lovell-Badge added, the main concern is ""whether the three babies born are going to be healthy and looked after well"".",0

He Jiankui fired by Shenzhen-based university as China says he defied government bans in pursuit of personal profit.
A Chinese scientist who claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies has been accused of circumventing regulations and acting in his own interests, in the preliminary findings of an official investigation into the case as the academic was fired from his job.
State news agency Xinhua on Monday reported that He Jiankui had “defied government bans and conducted the research in the pursuit of personal fame and gain”.
It added that the investigation also found a second woman had become pregnant as a result of the experiment.
The Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in the city of Shenzhen, said it had fired the researcher.
He Jiankui shocked the scientific community last year after announcing he had successfully altered the genes of twin girls born in November to prevent them from contracting HIV.
He told a human genome forum in Hong Kong that month that there had been “another potential pregnancy” involving a second couple, but when questioned further said the woman had had a miscarriage.
The investigation confirmed the woman was still pregnant, Xinhua said.
She would be put under medical observation along with the twin girls from the first pregnancy, it added.
‘Evaded oversight’
He, the scientist, said the twins’ DNA was modified using a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes.
Experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could harm not only an individual but also future generations who inherit these same changes.
Hundreds of Chinese and international scientists condemned He and said the use of gene-editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was unethical.
Chinese authorities denounced He’s work as “extremely abominable” at the end of November, suspended him from his job and began investigating his activities.
The academic “deliberately evaded oversight” with the intent of creating a gene-edited baby “for the purpose of reproduction”, the investigating team set up by the Health Commission of China in southern Guangdong province found, according to Xinhua.
The safety and efficacy of the technologies He used were unreliable, the report said. It stressed that creating gene-edited babies for reproduction is banned by national decree.
He’s university distanced itself from him as soon as the experiment was revealed, suspending him from work.
On Monday, it announced he had been fired.
“Effective immediately, SUSTech will rescind the work contract with Dr Jiankui He and terminate any of his teaching and research activities at SUSTech,” the university said in a statement on its website on Monday.
Neither He nor a representative could be reached for comment.
He’s announcement sparked a debate among Chinese legal scholars over which laws He had broken by carrying out the procedure, as well as whether he could be held criminally responsible or not.
Many scholars pointed to a 2003 guideline that bans altered human embryos from being implanted for the purpose of reproduction and says altered embryos cannot be developed for more than 14 days.
Information on those suspected of committing crimes had been sent to the Ministry of Public Security, Xinhua said.
‘Seeking personal fame and profit’
Xinhua said He raised funds independently and privately organised a team of people to carry out the procedure, adding that he had forged ethical review papers in order to enlist volunteers for the procedure.
Eight volunteer couples – HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers – signed up for the trial, investigators found, with one couple dropping out halfway through.
Speaking at the genome summit in Hong Kong in November, He said he was “proud” of altering the genes of the babies, given the stigma affecting those living with the virus in the country.
But such gene-editing work is banned in most countries, including China.
He will be “dealt with seriously according to the law,” and his case will be “handed over to public security organs for handling,” Xinhua said.
This is not the first time Chinese researchers have experimented with human embryo technology.
In 2017, scientists at Sun Yat-sen University used an adapted version of gene-editing to correct a disease-causing mutation in human embryos.",0
294,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-foiegras-idUSL5N1GM5YX,"PARIS (Reuters) - The foie gras industry, hit by a bird flu crisis for the second year running, needs to change production methods to protect its poultry flocks, a producers group said on Thursday, warning that will raise the price of the delicacy.
France, which has the largest poultry flock in the European Union, has been severely hit by the H5N8 bird flu virus that has been spreading in Europe since late last year. It led to the death or culling of 3.7 million ducks in the southwestern part of the country, home to most foie gras producers, according to producers group Cifog.
“We are suffering but our responsibility now is to establish rules that will protect farmers against events that tend to recur,” said Christophe Barrailh, head of Cifog.
Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is generally transmitted by migrating wild birds’ feaces and feathers but the virus can then move from one farm to another if trucks or people exiting farms are not disinfected properly.
Ducks and geese, mostly reared for their livers that are artificially swollen through force-feeding to make foie gras, are most exposed to the virus due to free-range rearing and transport of animals between farms.
Among key measures, Cifog said farmers will operate from September 2018 an “all-in/all-out” production system to ensure a two week break between each batch to avoid contamination and to fully disinfect premises.
This would lead to a fall in output of around 15 percent, Barrailh said.
Cifog said it will also ask the government to order the confinement of all ducks in buildings between Nov. 15 and Jan. 15 if flocks are at risk of being infected by wild birds. It hopes to have a response from the government by mid-April.
Some farmers are against the proposals, notably smaller farm unions Confederation Paysanne and Coordination Rurale who said they would lead to an industralization of the sector.
Cifog estimated the confinement measures would need 1,000 premises to be built costing each farm about 100,000 euros ($106,000) to maintain current volumes. Some farmers will likely prefer leaving their farm empty during the risky period.
“Higher costs and lower volumes. Obviously this will mean a rise in prices,” Barrailh said when asked about the impact of the measures. “That’s how the market works.”
Duck farmers make an average gross margin of 2.5 euros per duck, which can then make about 500 grams of foie gras.
Cifog estimated the cost of this year’s bird flu outbreak for the foie gras sector at 250 million euros ($265 million)without taking account of the costs of further measures.

295,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16O2LG,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. trading partners on Friday limited shipments of poultry from Alabama, a top producer of chickens for meat, over bird flu concerns as the state’s wait for federal confirmation of two suspected cases stretched past a week.
The European Union, Kazakhstan and French Polynesia restricted shipments from Alabama counties with presumed cases of the disease, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website. The moves came a day after the state reported the agency’s national animal-health laboratories had confirmed a separate case of bird flu there.
Belarus blocked shipments from the entire state.
Alabama officials and poultry producers have been waiting since March 8 for the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) to confirm the two suspected cases, which involve a commercial chicken farm and a backyard flock, according to the state. The facility in Ames, Iowa, is the only one in the United States that officially confirms cases of avian flu.
Swift confirmation is important for U.S. trading partners, some of which restrict shipments from geographic areas with infected flocks, and for state officials, who want to know which strain of the virus they are battling.
Highly pathogenic, or lethal, bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another widespread outbreak could be a financial blow for poultry operators, such as Tyson Foods Inc or Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, because it could kill more birds or require flocks to be culled.
The national labs must determine the strain and pathogenicity of the disease in order to officially confirm an infection, according to the USDA. The process often takes just a day.
A rapid test can be made when poultry samples contain sufficient genetic material, USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said on Thursday. But the samples from Alabama’s two suspected cases contained low levels, meaning scientists had to start a testing process that can take 14 days, she said.
Tests by a USDA-approved lab in Alabama and the national labs have already identified the H7 subtype of the virus from samples in the two suspected cases, she said.
“Our department respects the science behind the testing and is patiently waiting for accurate results,” said Amy Belcher, spokeswoman for Alabama’s agriculture department.
Alabama authorities presume the suspected cases are not highly lethal, or pathogenic, bird flu because the animals did not show signs of being sick. Still, officials have been checking birds at nearby farms for infections and the owners of the suspect flocks culled the birds, according to Alabama’s state veterinarian.
The United States must alert the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) if Alabama’s suspected cases are confirmed as positive, a step that could trigger more trade restrictions.
The OIE said “it is more important for the laboratory to be sure of its analysis than to be fast with it.”

296,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-birdflu-california-idUSKBN0ME1UI20150318,"PARIS (Reuters) - The United States has reported a mild form of bird flu on a turkey farm in California, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday, the latest in a series of outbreaks to hit the U.S. poultry industry in recent months.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report posted on the OIE website that a commercial turkey flock in Merced County, near San Francisco, had been coughing with a slight increase in mortality last week.
Samples were submitted for laboratory testing and were confirmed positive for low pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza, it said.
The infected premises was placed under quarantine following preliminary findings and an epidemiological investigation was initiated, it said. Follow-up surveillance and testing on 10 associated farms showed negative results for bird flu.
The strain discovered differed from the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu which has been found recently in other states, notably Arkansas, the heart of America’s poultry producing region.
It was also different from the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu found on a Californian turkey farm in January which prompted five export markets to bar imports of poultry from the state.
Bird flu viruses are divided into two groups based on their ability to cause disease, or pathogenicity. Highly pathogenic bird flu spreads rapidly, may cause serious disease and has high death rates in birds. The H5N1 and H7N9 types have also been found in humans, causing several hundred deaths.
Low pathogenic bird flu causes milder disease that may be undetected.
However, the H7 variant can mutate into a highly pathogenic type, prompting extreme precaution even in cases of low pathogenic outbreaks.

297,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-southkorea-idUSL3N1GJ1F5,"SEOUL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have limited imports of U.S. poultry after the United States detected its first case this year of avian flu on a commercial chicken farm, South Korea’s government and a U.S. trade group said on Monday.
South Korea will ban imports of U.S. poultry and eggs after a strain of H7 bird flu virus was confirmed on Sunday at a chicken farm in Tennessee, South Korea’s agriculture ministry said.
Japan and Taiwan will block poultry from the state, while Hong Kong will restrict imports from the Tennessee county where the infected flock was located, said James Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, a trade group.
The limits will reduce the potential for major U.S. chicken companies, such as Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N and Pilgrim's Pride PPC.O, to sell poultry overseas.
The Tennessee farm infected with avian flu was contracted to sell birds to Tyson.
South Korea’s import ban took effect on Monday, the agriculture ministry said in a statement. Live poultry and eggs are subject to the ban, while heat-treated chicken meat and egg products can still be imported, the statement noted.
South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, has been importing eggs from the United States as its worst-ever bird flu, or avian influenza (AI), outbreak has tightened the country’s egg supplies.
The latest moves do not affect China, which introduced a ban on imports of U.S. poultry and eggs in late 2015.
So far this year South Korea has shipped in nearly 1,049 tonnes of U.S. eggs, according to ministry data, accounting for more than 98 percent of its total egg imports as of March 3.
Sumner said South Korea’s decision to prohibit shipments of U.S. shell eggs was disappointing. Its move to continue imports of certain processed egg products was “good because Korea’s got this terrible AI problem and they were definitely in need of eggs,” he said.
South Korea resumed U.S. poultry imports in June last year after imposing a ban in early 2016 when bird flu cases were detected in the United States.
The resumption of the U.S. import ban means South Korea can import chicken meat from Brazil, Chile, Australia, Canada, the Philippines and Thailand.
Live poultry imports are limited to farm birds from New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

298,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16L1UX,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Aviagen [EWESJA.UL], the world’s leading poultry breeding company, has euthanized chickens at a farm in Alabama over concerns about bird flu, the company said on Tuesday, as likely cases of the disease emerged in a top chicken-producing state.
Alabama officials said they suspected that poultry at three sites in the state were infected with the virus, about a week after some 90,500 chickens were culled over infections at two commercial operations across the border in Tennessee.
Aviagen detected the presence of antibodies for the flu virus in a flock in Alabama that showed “no evidence of clinical disease,” company spokeswoman Marla Robinson said in an email. The company is based in Alabama.
The company euthanized the flock and “all eggs which were collected from that farm in the production system were traced and removed,” she said. Aviagen did not respond to a question about how many birds were killed.
Tony Frazier, Alabama’s state veterinarian, said the company chose to cull about 15,000 birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the farm had 153,000 birds.
A national USDA lab is testing samples from poultry in Alabama to identify the strain of the virus and how lethal it is for birds, after another agency-approved lab identified the H7 subtype of the disease in samples, USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said.
The birds in Alabama did not show clinical signs of sickness, which indicates they did not have a highly lethal, or pathogenic, form of the virus, Cole said.
In Tennessee, both cases were identified as H7N9. The USDA on March 5 confirmed that one was the United States’ first infection of highly pathogenic flu in commercial poultry in a year. Days later, the state said it had found the other case nearby and it was low pathogenic.
Highly pathogenic bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another highly pathogenic outbreak would likely represent a financial blow for poultry operators such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp because it would kill more birds or require flocks to be culled.
It also would likely trigger more import bans from trading partners, after South Korea, Japan and other countries limited imports after the highly pathogenic case in Tennessee.
Health officials have said the risk of bird flu spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe was low.
Separately, Frazier said the owner of a backyard flock suspected of having the virus chose to cull about 70 birds. No poultry linked to the third suspected case, which involved birds at a flea market, have been culled, he said.
Frazier said the cases were still only suspected flu infections and needed to be confirmed by the USDA. Earlier, the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries called a news conference to discuss what it said were three findings of avian influenza.
Alabama raised more than 1 billion chickens for meat in 2015, making it the country’s third largest producer, according to the USDA.
The national USDA laboratory, to which samples from the state were sent, is the only one in the United States that officially confirms cases.
The World Organization for Animal Health requires that all confirmed low-pathogenic H5 and H7 bird flu subtypes be reported because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Highly pathogenic cases also must be reported.

300,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-southkorea-idUSKBN16J058,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea plans to lift import tariffs for chicken from early April in a bid to prevent price increases amid the country’s worst bird flu outbreak and a ban on U.S. poultry imports, its agriculture ministry said on Sunday.
The import tariff cuts are likely to take effect from early April after consultations with other related ministries, the agriculture ministry said in a statement. The ministry expected the cuts to help stabilize local chicken prices as imported chickens are cheaper than domestic ones.
The move comes as South Korean producers are seeking to raise chicken prices following the country’s ban on U.S. poultry imports after a bird flu outbreak in the United States last week, stoking fears of a chicken shortage.
South Korea is self-sufficient in chicken supplies, but it also imports chicken for processed food, mainly from Brazil.
Along with the import tariff cuts, the ministry said it will release 2,000 tonnes of government chicken inventory from March 21 at lower prices to ease worries over supply.
The average chicken retail price per kilogram rose 5.7 percent to 5,713 won ($4.98) as of March 10 since the country’s import ban of U.S. poultry on March 6, according to state-run Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp. Despite the price increase, it was seen lower than the yearly average price of 5,938 won.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement that a case of H5N6 avian influenza was discovered at a chicken farm north of Seoul, while another case of the H5N8 strain was found at a duck farm in the southwestern part of the country.
The new cases represent a setback for Korea, fighting its worst-ever bird flu epidemic since mid-November last year. The spread of the virus had appeared to be waning since late January.
Bird flu fears are spreading across the world. Most recently, the United States reported an outbreak, prompting Asian nations including South Korea to halt imports of U.S. poultry.
Korea had not seen any new cases of bird flu for 15 days up to Feb. 22, when an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu virus was confirmed at a duck farm. Since then a total of 13 cases have been reported, the ministry said.

Authorities killed and buried chickens at the site in Giles County, Tennessee, “as a precaution” after a case of highly pathogenic flu in Lincoln County led to the deaths of about 73,500 chickens over the weekend, according to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. It said officials did not believe birds at one premise sickened those at the other.
Highly pathogenic bird flu is often fatal for domesticated poultry and led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015. Low-pathogenic flu is less serious and can cause coughing, depression and other symptoms in birds.
The highly pathogenic case in Tennessee was the first such infection in a commercial U.S. operation in more than a year and heightened fears among chicken producers that the disease may return.
The spread of highly pathogenic flu could represent a financial blow for poultry operators, such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, because it would kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It also would trigger more import bans from other countries, after South Korea, Japan and other nations limited imports because of the case in Lincoln County.
Jack Shere, chief veterinary officer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said in an interview that there was speculation the highly pathogenic virus found in Tennessee shared similar characteristics with a low-pathogenic virus that circulated in Tennessee, Kentucky, Minnesota and Illinois in 2009.
Wild migratory birds can carry the flu without showing symptoms and spread it to poultry through feces, feathers or other contact.
“This virus can mutate very easily, so low-pathogenic issues are just as important - when they are circulating among the wild birds - as the high-pathogenic issues,” Shere said.
Both cases in Tennessee were located along the state’s southern border with Alabama, one of the country’s top producers of “broiler” chickens for meat. They also were both in facilities for chickens that bred broiler birds and involved the same strain, H7N9, according to Tennessee’s agriculture department.
The state said it was testing poultry within a 10-kilometer radius of the Giles County site for the flu and so far had not found any other sick flocks.
“When routine testing showed a problem at this facility, the operators immediately took action and notified our lab,” said Charles Hatcher, Tennessee’s state veterinarian.
H7N9 is the same name as a strain of the virus that has killed people in China, but U.S. authorities said the Tennessee virus was genetically distinct.
U.S. officials have said the risk of bird flu spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe was low.
Low-pathogenic bird flu also was recently detected on a turkey farm in Wisconsin. Authorities there decided to keep the birds under quarantine until they tested negative for the virus, rather than to cull them, according to the state.

Arkansas officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, according to USDA. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.
In response to the news, Japan’s farm ministry halted imports of live poultry and poultry meat from Arkansas from Thursday, a ministry official said. It has already imposed bans on imports from nine other states, including Minnesota, Missouri and Kansas this month, its website showed.
Other countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua have also restricted poultry exports from U.S. states that have suffered bird flu outbreaks, including California and Oregon.
A spokesman for the Philippines’ Department of Agriculture said its ban would probably be extended to Arkansas once it had received formal notification of the outbreak there.

306,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL2N1H41DB,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Georgia has confirmed its first-ever case of bird flu in commercial poultry, its agriculture department said on Monday, widening an outbreak of the disease into the United States’ biggest chicken meat-producing state.
A flock of 18,000 chickens used for breeding was culled after testing positive for H7 bird flu, according to the agriculture department. It said the birds in far northwestern Georgia were likely infected with a form of the virus that is not highly lethal because the flock did not show signs of illness.
The discovery came after officials in Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee confirmed cases of highly pathogenic, or lethal, and low pathogenic H7N9 bird flu in breeding operations this month. U.S. officials have said the risk of the disease spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe is low.
But the spread of highly pathogenic bird flu to poultry in new states would represent a financial risk for meat companies because it could kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It could also trigger more import bans from other countries after South Korea and other buyers limited U.S. poultry shipments following highly pathogenic cases in Tennessee.
The worst-ever U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu in poultry in 2014 and 2015 killed about 50 million birds, most of which were egg-laying hens in Iowa.
More than 200,000 breeding chickens in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky have been killed in recent weeks by high and low pathogenic bird flu or culled to contain the virus, according to state officials. U.S. poultry producers had about 55.1 million breeder hens on hand as of March 1, according to the USDA.
In 2015, Georgia produced 7.9 billion pounds of chicken meat valued at $4.2 billion, the agency said.
“Poultry is the top sector of our number one industry, agriculture, and we are committed to protecting the livelihoods of the many farm families that are dependent on it,” Gary Black, Georgia’s agriculture commissioner, said in a statement.
Some companies are still feeling pressure related to the 2015 losses.
On Monday, Cal-Maine Foods, the biggest U.S. egg producer, said its quarterly sales fell about 32 percent from a year ago because prices were under pressure after farmers increased production in response to an outbreak two years ago.

307,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-southkorea-idUSL3N1GP03I,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea plans to lift import tariffs for chicken from early April in a bid to prevent price increases amid the country’s worst bird flu outbreak and a ban on U.S. poultry imports, its agriculture ministry said on Sunday.
The import tariff cuts are likely to take effect from early April after consultations with other related ministries, the agriculture ministry said in a statement. The ministry expected the cuts to help stabilize local chicken prices as imported chickens are cheaper than domestic ones.
The move comes as South Korean producers are seeking to raise chicken prices following the country’s ban on U.S. poultry imports after a bird flu outbreak in the United States last week, stoking fears of a chicken shortage.
South Korea is self-sufficient in chicken supplies, but it also imports chicken for processed food, mainly from Brazil.
Along with the import tariff cuts, the ministry said it will release 2,000 tonnes of government chicken inventory from March 21 at lower prices to ease worries over supply.
The average chicken retail price per kilogram rose 5.7 percent to 5,713 won ($4.98) as of March 10 since the country’s import ban of U.S. poultry on March 6, according to state-run Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp. Despite the price increase, it was seen lower than the yearly average price of 5,938 won.
South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, has been grappling with a bird flu outbreak since late last year, culling more than 35 million farm birds, or over a fifth of South Korean poultry.

- Farm and surrounding facilities are quarantined
- Tyson Foods says it has a contract with farm owner
(CNN)A strain of bird flu has been found in a commercial chicken farm in Tennessee, the US Department of Agriculture and state government agencies said Sunday.
The H7 strain of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, was found in a flock of 73,500 chickens in Lincoln County, in the central part of the state on the border with Alabama, the USDA said.
The facility alerted authorities Friday that a large number of chickens were dying, the USDA said.
Tyson Foods said the farm is owned by an individual who contracts with the company.
""We're responding aggressively, and are working with state and federal officials to contain the virus by euthanizing chickens located on the farm,"" Tyson said. ""All flocks located within a 6-mile radius of the farm will be tested and will not be transported unless they test negative for the virus.""
""Birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system,"" the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said.
This is the first known case of HPAI in a commercial poultry facility in the United States this year, the USDA said. This is also the first HPAI case in Tennessee, the state said.
In January 2016, a commercial turkey farm in Dubois County, Indiana, tested positive for the H7N8 strain of avian influenza.
""These virus strains can travel in wild birds without them appearing sick,"" the USDA said of the latest outbreak. ""People should avoid contact with sick/dead poultry or wildlife. If contact occurs, wash your hands with soap and water and change clothing before having any contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds.""
This kind of bird flu doesn't pose a risk to the food supply, the Tennessee statement said, and the risk of human infection during bird flu outbreaks is low.
Bird flu is a bigger problem overseas than in the United States. A total of 460 people in China have had confirmed infections of avian influenza since October, according to the World Health Organization.
In 2014, a man in Alberta, Canada, died from bird flu. In 2015, millions of birds were euthanized after an outbreak in Iowa.
Bird flu usually just affects birds. Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions and feces.
Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia.
There are many strains of avian flu, 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans.",3
309,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL2N1GU05Y,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. trading partners on Friday limited shipments of poultry from Alabama, a top producer of chickens for meat, over bird flu concerns as the state’s wait for federal confirmation of two suspected cases stretched past a week.
The European Union, Kazakhstan and French Polynesia restricted shipments from Alabama counties with presumed cases of the disease, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website. The moves came a day after the state reported the agency’s national animal-health laboratories had confirmed a separate case of bird flu there.
Belarus blocked shipments from the entire state.
Alabama officials and poultry producers have been waiting since March 8 for the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) to confirm the two suspected cases, which involve a commercial chicken farm and a backyard flock, according to the state. The facility in Ames, Iowa, is the only one in the United States that officially confirms cases of avian flu.
Swift confirmation is important for U.S. trading partners, some of which restrict shipments from geographic areas with infected flocks, and for state officials, who want to know which strain of the virus they are battling.
Highly pathogenic, or lethal, bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another widespread outbreak could be a financial blow for poultry operators, such as Tyson Foods Inc or Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, because it could kill more birds or require flocks to be culled.
The national labs must determine the strain and pathogenicity of the disease in order to officially confirm an infection, according to the USDA. The process often takes just a day.
A rapid test can be made when poultry samples contain sufficient genetic material, USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said on Thursday. But the samples from Alabama’s two suspected cases contained low levels, meaning scientists had to start a testing process that can take 14 days, she said.
Tests by a USDA-approved lab in Alabama and the national labs have already identified the H7 subtype of the virus from samples in the two suspected cases, she said.
“Our department respects the science behind the testing and is patiently waiting for accurate results,” said Amy Belcher, spokeswoman for Alabama’s agriculture department.
Alabama authorities presume the suspected cases are not highly lethal, or pathogenic, bird flu because the animals did not show signs of being sick. Still, officials have been checking birds at nearby farms for infections and the owners of the suspect flocks culled the birds, according to Alabama’s state veterinarian.
The United States must alert the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) if Alabama’s suspected cases are confirmed as positive, a step that could trigger more trade restrictions.
The OIE said “it is more important for the laboratory to be sure of its analysis than to be fast with it.”

310,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-birdflu-india-idUSKBN0ME1ZA20150318,"PARIS (Reuters) - India reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus in a village in the northern province of Uttar Pradesh, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday.
Nearly 190 birds died of the virus in a village in Amethi district, the Indian agriculture ministry said in a report posted on the OIE website.
An epidemiological investigation was ongoing and an intensive surveillance campaign has been launched in a 10 km radius zone, it said.
Highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu first infected humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths.

311,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL5N1GK3IW,"PARIS (Reuters) - The United States reported an outbreak of avian flu on a farm in Wisconsin, the second in the country in less than a week although the virus found this time is considered less virulent, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.
A strain of low pathogenic H5N2 avian flu has been discovered in a flock of 84,000 turkeys in Barron County, Wisconsin, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a report posted on the website of the Paris-based OIE.
The USDA said the turkey flock was tested after birds showed signs of depression and the infected premises were quarantined.
The new outbreak comes after the detection of highly pathogenic H7 bird flu last week in a chicken breeder flock in Tennessee farm contracted by U.S. food giant Tyson Foods Inc.
As opposed to highly pathogenic strains which can cause high mortality rates among poultry, low pathogenic ones typically cause few or no clinical signs in birds.
In 2014 and 2015, during a widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu, primarily of the H5N2 strain, the United States killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens. The losses pushed U.S. egg prices to record highs.
The USDA said tests had shown that the H5N2 virus detected in Wisconsin was of North American wild bird origin and distinct from the H5N2 viruses found in 2015.
The risk of human infection in poultry outbreaks is low, although in China more than 110 people died this winter amid an outbreak of the H7N9 virus in birds.
The detection of a first case of bird flu in the United States this year prompted several Asian countries, including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, to limit imports of U.S. poultry.

312,http://www.reuters.com/article/asia-birdflu-idUSL5N1GU343,"ROME, March 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Countries trading in Chinese poultry should step up surveillance at farms, markets and border checkpoints to prevent the spread of H7N9 bird flu from China after a more severe strain of the virus was detected in chickens, a U.N. agency said on Friday.
H7N9 has killed almost 500 people in China since it was first reported in 2013 but until recently had shown little or no clinical symptoms in birds, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
But in February Beijing reported it detected an evolution in the virus that caused severe disease and death in poultry within 48 hours of infection.
“It now goes beyond being primarily a public health concern,” said FAO’s veterinary epidemiologist Sophie von Dobschuetz, adding the new strain heightened the risk for farmers to lose animals and livelihoods.
The highly pathogenic variant has only been reported in China’s southeastern Guangdong province and will become more apparent in some flocks if birds begin to die off, making detection and control easier, FAO said.
“The earlier you pick up the incursion of the virus the more chance you have to control it,” von Dobschuetz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
The new strain has raised concerns that the infection could pass from chickens to other birds, increasing the risk of it spreading across borders, the FAO said in joint statement with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
The FAO said the new H7N9 strain maintained its capacity to cause severe illness in people, but the World Health Organization said there was no evidence of changes in the virus’ ability to spread between humans.
Von Dobschuetz said China was assessing the virus’ prevalence and results were expected in the coming weeks.
Since the virus was first identified in 2013, 1,320 human cases have been recorded in China, including 492 deaths, according to FAO figures.

313,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-tracking-idUSL1N0WF1DW20150313,"CHICAGO, March 13 (Reuters) - A virulent strain of avian flu that has killed turkeys in the heart of the nation’s poultry region has been found through molecular testing to be nearly identical to viruses isolated in migratory ducks.
But some wildlife experts are skeptical of suggestions that wild birds are responsible for spreading the H5N2 flu strain that has infected poultry in Minnesota, Missouri and Arkansas.
A top investigator from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says that testing performed by the government supports a conclusion that the virus is being carried by waterfowl along an established migratory route that stretches south from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. The virus can be transmitted to poultry from ducks through droppings that land on farms or when birds interact, among other ways.
“That’s the way we’re sort of pointing right now: to ducks as the problem,” said Brian McCluskey, lead epidemiologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The agency has not, however, identified how the disease made its way from the ducks to domestic fowl.
Experts who doubt that wild birds are spreading the virus note that the disease has moved from Minnesota in the north, south to Arkansas and Missouri, the opposite direction birds migrate through the area in the spring.
“When you’re talking about where I would put my money, I would say that north to south movement in the beginning of March totally does not make sense,” said Hon Ip, a microbiologist for the National Wildlife Health Center.
Determining how avian flu is spreading is crucial to preventing future outbreaks, protecting poultry and limiting damage in the $5.7 billion export market. Already, the outbreak has prompted top poultry importers, including Mexico and Canada, to widen trade restrictions.
Previous outbreaks on the West Coast were linked to wild fowl by the USDA. But the virus can be spread in other ways, too, including through contaminated trucks, humans or animal feed. People can carry infected material, such as feces or even feathers, to farms on their clothes, shoes or vehicles.
Once it arrives, avian flu can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 24 hours. The virus has not been identified in humans and is not expected to pose a public health risk, according to the USDA.
The infection in a Minnesota turkey flock was the first along the migratory route known as the Mississippi flyway, which also includes Missouri and Arkansas -- and continues southeast toward the major chicken producing states of Mississippi and Alabama.
After the Minnesota case was identified on March 5, the USDA organized a call to advise state veterinarians along the route that the virus could be headed in their direction, said Richard Fordyce, director of Missouri’s Department of Agriculture.
But wildlife experts question whether wild birds are moving the virus along the flyway.
“It is extraordinarily unlikely that avian influenza in the turkey flock in Minnesota has anything to do with wild birds,” said Lou Cornicelli, wildlife research manager for the Minnesota Division of Fish and Wildlife . He noted that few migratory ducks have started arriving in Minnesota.
“I would think the investigation is going to look more toward the biosecurity issue with food or transport,” Cornicelli added. “The fact that there are no ducks here would indicate that it’s not ducks in Minnesota.”
One day after the USDA confirmed avian flu in Minnesota, state wildlife employees took a low-level airplane flight to scout a 15-mile radius around an infected turkey farm for wild birds that could have carried the virus.
They spotted just 18 swans and 100 ducks, and they appeared to be “city birds” that do not migrate, Cornicelli said. The state nevertheless tested feces from some of the ducks for avian flu, but the results were negative.
Arkansas officials doubt the role of migratory birds in their state’s outbreak, too, partly because the area with the infected farm does not attract many wild birds and waterfowl, said Karen Rowe, bird conservation program leader for the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission.
Most birds in Arkansas are flying north at this time of year, Rowe added. She plans to travel to the farm next week to look for clues about how the virus could have spread.
“Was it carried in on clothing or boots? There’s just a lot of unanswered questions,” Rowe said.
Butterball LLC, which has contracts to buy turkeys from farms in Arkansas and Missouri that were infected, declined to speculate about how the virus was spread.
Cargill Inc contracts for turkeys from an infected farm near Fortuna, Missouri, and said the origin of that infection is under investigation.
“We know that AI is spread by migratory wild waterfowl,” spokesman Michael Martin said, referring to the virus. “However, we are not taking anything for granted.” (Reporting by Tom Polansek, Editing by Jo Winterbottom and Sue Horton)",3

315,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16G31R,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has $80 million to $90 million left over from the last major outbreak of bird flu to fight any new discoveries of the virus, the department’s chief veterinary officer said on Thursday.
USDA must appeal to Congress if more money is needed to fight the disease, which was recently found in two U.S. states and also has been confirmed across Asia and in Europe.
Any potential request for emergency funding is complicated as U.S. President Donald Trump’s choice for the position has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.
“It would be more streamlined of course if there was a secretary here,” Jack Shere, USDA’s chief veterinary officer said in an interview.
Trump’s nominee for secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine.
“When we have outbreaks of bird flu happening all over the world, we need someone with his background and knowledge in the office ASAP,” said Marcus Rust, a member of Trump’s agricultural advisory committee and chief executive of Rose Acre Farms, the second biggest U.S. egg producer.
It costs about $1 million to $2 million in indemnity payments to pay farmers for the birds that must be killed by any outbreak of the disease. The USDA also uses the funds to kill any affected birds, as well as dispose of the bodies and clean the poultry farms, a process known as virus elimination and disinfection.
Congress authorized $1 billion to fight a bird flu epidemic that devastated the U.S. poultry industry in 2014 and 2015. USDA spent $600 million of that on virus elimination and disinfection and $200 million in indemnity payments, Shere said.
Nearly 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens were killed during that outbreak.
U.S. officials are working to determine how a Tennessee farm, which was a supplier to Tyson Foods Inc, became infected with a strain of highly pathogenic H7 bird flu. All 73,500 birds there were killed by the disease or suffocated with foam to prevent its spread government and company officials said on Sunday.

317,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16F03R,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The strain of bird flu that infected a chicken farm in Tennessee in recent days shares the same name as a form of the virus that has killed humans in China, but is genetically distinct from it, U.S. authorities said on Tuesday.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture identified the strain in Tennessee as H7N9, following a full genome sequencing of samples from the farm. It said all eight gene segments of the virus had North American wild bird lineage.
On Sunday, the USDA confirmed the farm in Tennessee was infected with highly pathogenic bird flu, making it the first case in a commercial U.S. operation in more than a year.
In China, at least 112 people have died from H7N9 bird flu this winter, Xinhua news agency said on Friday.
However, that virus has Eurasian lineage, U.S. flu experts said.
“Even though the numbers and the letters are the same, if you look at the genetic fingerprint of that virus, it is different,” said Dan Jernigan, director of the influenza division at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Jernigan said the risk to humans from the virus found in Tennessee is low. Genome sequencing shows the H7N9 virus did not have genetic features present in the virus in China that make it easier for humans to become infected, he said.
The virus found in Tennessee likely mutated to become highly pathogenic from a less dangerous, low pathogenic form, he said.
Disease experts fear a deadly strain of bird flu could mutate into a form that could be passed easily between people and become a pandemic.
Multiple outbreaks of the virus have been reported in poultry farms and wild flocks across Europe, Africa and Asia in the past six months. Most involved strains that were low risks for human health, but the sheer number of different types, and their simultaneous presence in so many parts of the world, has increased the risk of viruses mixing and mutating - and possibly jumping to people, according to disease experts.
China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said the majority of people infected by H7N9 in China reported exposure to poultry, especially at live markets.
Identifying the viruses in Tennessee and China both as H7N9 is similar to having two cars from different states with the same license plate number, said Carol Cardona, avian flu expert at the University of Minnesota.
The strain in Tennessee “is NOT the same as the China H7N9 virus that has impacted poultry and infected humans in Asia,” the USDA emphasized in a statement.
“While the subtype is the same as the China H7N9 lineage that emerged in 2013, this is a different virus and is genetically distinct from the China H7N9 lineage,” the USDA added.
U.S. officials are working to determine how the Tennessee farm, which was a supplier to Tyson Foods Inc, became infected. All 73,500 birds there were killed by the disease or suffocated with foam to prevent its spread.
Tyson, the world’s biggest chicken company, is “hopeful this is an isolated incident,” spokesman Worth Sparkman said.
Authorities have not identified the name of the farm or the town in Lincoln County, Tennessee, where it is located.

The flock of 40,020 turkeys in Boone County, Arkansas, is located within the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along which the same strain of H5N2 bird flu has previously been identified in Minnesota and Missouri.

319,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-tennessee-idUSL2N1GM272,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A commercial flock of 17,000 chickens in Tennessee has been culled after becoming infected with low-pathogenic bird flu, state agricultural officials said on Thursday, days after a more dangerous form of the disease killed poultry in a neighboring county.
Authorities killed and buried chickens at the site in Giles County, Tennessee, “as a precaution” after a case of highly pathogenic flu in Lincoln County led to the deaths of about 73,500 chickens over the weekend, according to the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. It said officials did not believe birds at one premise sickened those at the other.
Highly pathogenic bird flu is often fatal for domesticated poultry and led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015. Low-pathogenic flu is less serious and can cause coughing, depression and other symptoms in birds.
The highly pathogenic case in Tennessee was the first such infection in a commercial U.S. operation in more than a year and heightened fears among chicken producers that the disease may return.
The spread of highly pathogenic flu could represent a financial blow for poultry operators, such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, because it would kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It also would trigger more import bans from other countries, after South Korea, Japan and other nations limited imports because of the case in Lincoln County.
Jack Shere, chief veterinary officer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said in an interview that there was speculation the highly pathogenic virus found in Tennessee shared similar characteristics with a low-pathogenic virus that circulated in Tennessee, Kentucky, Minnesota and Illinois in 2009.
Wild migratory birds can carry the flu without showing symptoms and spread it to poultry through feces, feathers or other contact.
“This virus can mutate very easily, so low-pathogenic issues are just as important - when they are circulating among the wild birds - as the high-pathogenic issues,” Shere said.
Both cases in Tennessee were located along the state’s southern border with Alabama, one of the country’s top producers of “broiler” chickens for meat. They also were both in facilities for chickens that bred broiler birds and involved the same strain, H7N9, according to Tennessee’s agriculture department.
The state said it was testing poultry within a 10-kilometer radius of the Giles County site for the flu and so far had not found any other sick flocks.
“When routine testing showed a problem at this facility, the operators immediately took action and notified our lab,” said Charles Hatcher, Tennessee’s state veterinarian.
H7N9 is the same name as a strain of the virus that has killed people in China, but U.S. authorities said the Tennessee virus was genetically distinct.
U.S. officials have said the risk of bird flu spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe was low.
Low-pathogenic bird flu also was recently detected on a turkey farm in Wisconsin. Authorities there decided to keep the birds under quarantine until they tested negative for the virus, rather than to cull them, according to the state.

CHICAGO, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the first infection of a virulent strain of avian flu in poultry in Kansas, confirming the virus has spread into a migratory bird route that runs through the center of the country.
The discovery of the H5N2 flu strain in a backyard chicken and duck flock in a county just outside Kansas City, Kan., is certain to lead to expanded restrictions on U.S. poultry exports from top trading partners like Mexico and Canada.
The infection, confirmed on Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was the first case in an established migratory bird route, known as the central flyway, that stretches roughly north-south from Montana to Texas.
Kansas officials quarantined the infected property in Leavenworth County, and birds there will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease. A quarantine zone will be established for miles around the site to limit the movement of poultry.
“We are dedicated to providing the necessary assistance and precautions to avoid any possible spreading of the disease,” said Bill Brown, Kansas’ animal health commissioner,
The USDA will inform international trading partners and an international animal health organization of the infection. Major buyers of U.S. poultry have already restricted imports from other states that have recently been infected with the same flu strain.
Last week, the USDA identified the first case in Arkansas, in the heart of the U.S. poultry-producing region.
Molecular testing has shown the virus found in recent infections is nearly identical to viruses isolated in migratory ducks. But some wildlife experts are skeptical of suggestions that wild birds are responsible for spreading the flu in the Midwest.

321,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16N25T,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bird flu that is highly lethal to poultry has infected a second commercial chicken farm in Tennessee that supplies Tyson Foods Inc, company and state officials said on Thursday.
The finding expands an outbreak near the major chicken-producing states of Alabama and Georgia, and is the second in the type of breeder flock crucial for keeping the chicken-meat industry supplied with birds. A case of less dangerous bird flu was confirmed in Alabama on Thursday.
In Tennessee, authorities have started to cull the infected flock of 55,000 chickens in Lincoln County, to contain the highly pathogenic H7N9 flu, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The farm was in a quarantine zone established after authorities this month found the same strain of the disease in a flock of about 73,500 chickens less than 2 miles (3.2 km) away, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture said. That farm also supplied Tyson, the world’s biggest chicken company.
“I’m sure on the part of the company they’re quite concerned and going back and reviewing all of their information and data to determine how in the world this got into the buildings,” said Bret Marsh, state veterinarian in Indiana, which had the nation’s only highly pathogenic bird flu case in poultry in 2016.
The initial case in Tennessee was the nation’s first infection of highly pathogenic bird flu at a commercial operation in more than a year. Tennessee also recently detected a less-dangerous case of low-pathogenic flu in another chicken flock.
On Thursday, Alabama said the USDA confirmed a suspected case of low-pathogenic flu in a guinea fowl at a flea market as H7N9. Aviagen, the world’s largest poultry breeding company, has culled chickens in the state over concerns about the disease.
Highly pathogenic bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another widespread outbreak could represent a financial blow for poultry operators because it could kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It also would likely trigger more import bans from trading partners, after South Korea, Japan and other countries limited imports after the first highly pathogenic case in Tennessee.
China has also been grappling with an outbreak of H7N9, which has killed 161 people since October. U.S. authorities have said that strain is genetically distinct from the H7N9 in Tennessee and that the risk of the disease spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe is low.
Tyson said it worked with Tennessee and federal officials to quickly euthanize birds in the infected flock and did not expect disruptions to its chicken supply.
“Our business is diversified and scaled across multiple states, so we plan to meet our customers’ needs,” spokesman Worth Sparkman said.
Tyson shares fell 1.7 percent to close at $62.00 on Thursday.
The company has said it tests all the birds it owns for the virus and flocks diagnosed with highly pathogenic flu are not processed.
Wild birds can carry the disease without showing signs of sickness and transmit it to poultry through feces, feathers or other forms of contract.

322,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/05/tennessee-bird-flu-outbreak-poultry-farm,"A commercial chicken breeding facility in south-central Tennessee has been hit by a strain of bird flu, agriculture officials said on Sunday.
The state agriculture department said in a news release that tests confirmed the presence of the H7 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, at a facility in Lincoln County. The facility alerted the state veterinarian’s office on Friday, after an increase in chicken deaths.
The statement did not name the facility. The facility and about 30 other poultry farms within about a six-mile radius of the site are under quarantine.
“Animal health is our top priority,” said Dr Charles Hatcher, the state veterinarian. “With this HPAI detection, we are moving quickly and aggressively to prevent the virus from spreading.”
The US Department of Agriculture said 73,500 chickens were in the facility’s flock.
Officials said HPAI posed no risk to the food supply, and no affected chickens entered the food chain.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPAI can cause up to 100% mortality in flocks, often within 48 hours.
“Many Tennessee families rely on the poultry industry for their livelihoods, and the state is working closely with local, county and federal partners and the poultry industry to control the situation and protect the flocks that are critical to our state’s economy,” Tennessee governor Bill Haslam said.
According to the Tennessee Poultry Association, there are more than 1,650 commercial broiler and breeder houses on more than 550 family farms in the state. The state ranks 13th nationally in broiler production and processing with more than 6 million birds per week at five plants.
The statement said the most recent US detection of HPAI was in January 2016 in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana. More than 414,000 turkeys and chickens were euthanized to contain the outbreak.
In 2015, US poultry producers, primarily in the upper midwest, lost more than 48 million birds to bird flu. Minnesota, the country’s top turkey producer, and Iowa, the top chicken-egg producer, were the hardest-hit states.",3
323,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL5N1GK3DL,"PARIS, March 7 (Reuters) - The United States reported an outbreak of low pathogenic avian flu in a turkey flock in Wisconsin, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.
The strain, H5N2, is different from the highly pathogenic H7 virus detected in a chicken breeder flock in Tennessee farm contracted by U.S. food giant Tyson Foods Inc.
“Testing of the commercial turkey flock occurred after the birds exhibited signs of depression,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report posted on the OIE website.
“The infected premises was quarantined and the turkeys will be depopulated through controlled marketing.”
The virus detected in the flock of 84,000 turkeys in Wisconsin was of North American wild bird origin and distinct from the H5N2 virsuses detected in 2015, the USDA said.

324,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16L1UX?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Aviagen [EWESJA.UL], the world’s leading poultry breeding company, has euthanized chickens at a farm in Alabama over concerns about bird flu, the company said on Tuesday, as likely cases of the disease emerged in a top chicken-producing state.
Alabama officials said they suspected that poultry at three sites in the state were infected with the virus, about a week after some 90,500 chickens were culled over infections at two commercial operations across the border in Tennessee.
Aviagen detected the presence of antibodies for the flu virus in a flock in Alabama that showed “no evidence of clinical disease,” company spokeswoman Marla Robinson said in an email. The company is based in Alabama.
The company euthanized the flock and “all eggs which were collected from that farm in the production system were traced and removed,” she said. Aviagen did not respond to a question about how many birds were killed.
Tony Frazier, Alabama’s state veterinarian, said the company chose to cull about 15,000 birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the farm had 153,000 birds.
A national USDA lab is testing samples from poultry in Alabama to identify the strain of the virus and how lethal it is for birds, after another agency-approved lab identified the H7 subtype of the disease in samples, USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said.
The birds in Alabama did not show clinical signs of sickness, which indicates they did not have a highly lethal, or pathogenic, form of the virus, Cole said.
In Tennessee, both cases were identified as H7N9. The USDA on March 5 confirmed that one was the United States’ first infection of highly pathogenic flu in commercial poultry in a year. Days later, the state said it had found the other case nearby and it was low pathogenic.
Highly pathogenic bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another highly pathogenic outbreak would likely represent a financial blow for poultry operators such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp because it would kill more birds or require flocks to be culled.
It also would likely trigger more import bans from trading partners, after South Korea, Japan and other countries limited imports after the highly pathogenic case in Tennessee.
Health officials have said the risk of bird flu spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe was low.
Separately, Frazier said the owner of a backyard flock suspected of having the virus chose to cull about 70 birds. No poultry linked to the third suspected case, which involved birds at a flea market, have been culled, he said.
Frazier said the cases were still only suspected flu infections and needed to be confirmed by the USDA. Earlier, the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries called a news conference to discuss what it said were three findings of avian influenza.
Alabama raised more than 1 billion chickens for meat in 2015, making it the country’s third largest producer, according to the USDA.
The national USDA laboratory, to which samples from the state were sent, is the only one in the United States that officially confirms cases.
The World Organization for Animal Health requires that all confirmed low-pathogenic H5 and H7 bird flu subtypes be reported because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Highly pathogenic cases also must be reported.

In 2014 and 2015, during a widespread outbreak of HPAI, the United States killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens. The losses pushed U.S. egg prices to record highs and prompted trading partners to ban imports of American poultry, even though there was little infection then in the broiler industry.
No people were affected in that outbreak, which was primarily of the H5N2 strain. The risk of human infection in poultry outbreaks is low, although in China people have died this winter amid an outbreak of the H7N9 virus in birds.
The facility in Tennessee’s Lincoln County has been placed under quarantine, along with approximately 30 other poultry farms within a 6.2-mile (10 km) radius of the site, the state said. Other flocks in the quarantined area are being tested, it added.
Tyson, the USDA and the state did not name the facility involved. Tyson said that it did not expect disruptions to its chicken business.
The USDA should have more information by Monday evening about the particular strain of the virus involved, spokeswoman Donna Karlsons said by email.
HPAI bird flu was last found in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana in January 2016.
The USDA said it would inform the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and international trading partners of the outbreak.
The biggest traditional markets for U.S. chicken meat are Mexico and Canada, which introduced state or regional bans on U.S. broiler exports after the outbreak two years ago, and China, which imposed a national ban.
Tennessee’s broiler production is too small to rank it in the top five U.S. producing states but it is the third-largest generator of cash receipts in agriculture for the state.
In January, the USDA detected bird flu in a wild duck in Montana that appeared to match one of the strains found during the 2014 and 2015 outbreak.
The United States stepped up biosecurity measures aimed at preventing the spread of bird flu after the outbreak two years ago.
Tyson said precautions being taken include disinfecting all vehicles entering farms and banning all nonessential visitor access to contract farms.
In recent months, different strains of bird flu have been confirmed across Asia and in Europe. Authorities have culled millions of birds in affected areas to control the outbreaks.
France, which has the largest poultry flock in the European Union, has reported outbreaks of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu virus. In South Korea, the rapid spread of the H5N6 strain of the virus has led to the country’s worst-ever outbreak of bird flu.

CHICAGO, March 10 (Reuters) - A suspected case of avian influenza has been identified in poultry in Arkansas, the third-largest U.S. turkey producer and home to Tyson Foods Inc , the nation’s biggest chicken company, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday.
The infection, if confirmed, threatens to widen trading restrictions from countries such as Taiwan, Singapore and Nicaragua that have already limited U.S. poultry exports due to bird flu outbreaks in states ranging from Minnesota and Missouri to California.
“There is a suspect case in Arkansas, but testing is ongoing,” USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said.
Arkansas producers have been on alert for the virus since Minnesota and Missouri confirmed cases of highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu in the past week. The Minnesota case was the first in the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along the Mississippi River that also includes Missouri and Arkansas.
Bird flu is contagious and can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 48 hours. The virus has not been identified in humans and is not expected to pose a public health risk, according to USDA.
“It’s in the wild bird flyway coming from Canada,” Texas state veterinarian Dee Ellis said of the virus. “That’s obviously how it went from Minnesota to Missouri to Arkansas.”
Ellis could not confirm the Arkansas case.
On Wednesday, Texas will announce strengthened testing requirements for poultry coming in from states with bird flu outbreaks in a bid to keep out the virus, he said.
No flocks grown for Tyson have been diagnosed with bird flu, spokesman Worth Sparkman said, adding the company had become more diligent about biosecurity at poultry farms because of the virus.
The suspected case in Arkansas was found in a turkey flock, said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms Inc, the nation’s third-largest poultry producer. He cited information from the Texas Poultry Federation.
To prevent bird flu from spreading to its facilities, Sanderson is starting to bar outsiders from entering barns and to require increased cleaning of trucks hauling feed and chickens between farms, Cockrell said. In the past, employees have changed their clothes on airplanes after visiting infected locations, he added.
Transmission “can happen, whether it comes in on feces on your boot or a piece of a feather that got on a shirt when you’re out doing environmental inspections on a farm,” Cockrell said.
H5N2 was also found in turkey flocks in Minnesota and Missouri. The facilities were immediately quarantined, flocks were culled and authorities said the birds would not enter the food system. (Editing by Jo Winterbottom and Clarence Fernandez)",3

CHICAGO – In the two weeks since bird flu reappeared in Indiana, U.S. veterinarians have swabbed the mouths of chickens and turkeys across the country, racing to uncover any more infections and contain the virus before it causes mass death and damage like last year.
Biologists also are running tests on feces collected from wild birds, which are suspected of spreading the disease to farms.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on Jan. 15 that a turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, was infected with the H7N8 strain of the virus. It was the first new case of bird flu in U.S. poultry flocks since June.
More poultry flocks will likely fall ill in the coming months, veterinarians said, following an unprecedented outbreak last year that caused more than 48 million chickens and turkeys to die from sickness or because they had to be culled to contain the disease.
Anxiety over that risk is fueling vigilance among U.S. poultry producers and government officials looking for signs of infections. Increased testing could help limit the spread if new cases are detected quickly.
""Everybody's testing everything,"" said John Glisson, vice-president of research for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, an industry group.
In the days after the latest outbreak, when winter weather was hampering travel, the USDA arranged for a plane to fly poultry samples from farms near the infected site in Indiana to an Iowa lab to speed up testing, said Denise Derrer, spokeswoman for the Indiana Board of Animal Health.
Typically, the samples would be driven across Illinois.
State and federal authorities culled more than 400,000 birds near the infected farm to contain the outbreak. About 350,000 in the area were killed even though they were diagnosed with a less lethal form of bird flu or tested negative for the disease.
Officials said they wanted to be aggressive to avoid a repeat of last year's losses. USDA believes the less lethal virus type mutated into a more deadly strain in one flock.
Indiana has required testing in flocks as far as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the infected farm at least every five to seven days, exceeding the USDA's standard requirement for testing confined to a zone half that size.
Last year showed the passage of a few weeks without a new infection did not mean the end of the virus.
Minnesota, the nation's top turkey producing state, confirmed its first infection in poultry on March 5. Its next case was not detected until March 27, and the state subsequently lost 5 million turkeys.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Agriculture has $80 million to $90 million left over from the last major outbreak of bird flu to fight any new discoveries of the virus, the department's chief veterinary officer said on Thursday.
USDA must appeal to Congress if more money is needed to fight the disease, which was recently found in two U.S. states and also has been confirmed across Asia and in Europe.
Any potential request for emergency funding is complicated as U.S. President Donald Trump's choice for the position has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.
""It would be more streamlined of course if there was a secretary here,"" Jack Shere, USDA's chief veterinary officer said in an interview.
Trump's nominee for secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine.
""When we have outbreaks of bird flu happening all over the world, we need someone with his background and knowledge in the office ASAP,"" said Marcus Rust, a member of Trump's agricultural advisory committee and chief executive of Rose Acre Farms, the second biggest U.S. egg producer.
It costs about $1 million to $2 million in indemnity payments to pay farmers for the birds that must be killed by any outbreak of the disease. The USDA also uses the funds to kill any affected birds, as well as dispose of the bodies and clean the poultry farms, a process known as virus elimination and disinfection.
Congress authorized $1 billion to fight a bird flu epidemic that devastated the U.S. poultry industry in 2014 and 2015. USDA spent $600 million of that on virus elimination and disinfection and $200 million in indemnity payments, Shere said.
Nearly 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens were killed during that outbreak.

333,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL2N1GK20E,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The strain of bird flu that infected a chicken farm in Tennessee in recent days shares the same name as a form of the virus that has killed humans in China, but is genetically distinct from it, U.S. authorities said on Tuesday.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture identified the strain in Tennessee as H7N9, following a full genome sequencing of samples from the farm. It said all eight gene segments of the virus had North American wild bird lineage.
On Sunday, the USDA confirmed the farm in Tennessee was infected with highly pathogenic bird flu, making it the first case in a commercial U.S. operation in more than a year.
In China, at least 112 people have died from H7N9 bird flu this winter, Xinhua news agency said on Friday.
However, that virus has Eurasian lineage, U.S. flu experts said.
“Even though the numbers and the letters are the same, if you look at the genetic fingerprint of that virus, it is different,” said Dan Jernigan, director of the influenza division at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Jernigan said the risk to humans from the virus found in Tennessee is low. Genome sequencing shows the H7N9 virus did not have genetic features present in the virus in China that make it easier for humans to become infected, he said.
The virus found in Tennessee likely mutated to become highly pathogenic from a less dangerous, low pathogenic form, he said.
Disease experts fear a deadly strain of bird flu could mutate into a form that could be passed easily between people and become a pandemic.
Multiple outbreaks of the virus have been reported in poultry farms and wild flocks across Europe, Africa and Asia in the past six months. Most involved strains that were low risks for human health, but the sheer number of different types, and their simultaneous presence in so many parts of the world, has increased the risk of viruses mixing and mutating - and possibly jumping to people, according to disease experts.
China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said the majority of people infected by H7N9 in China reported exposure to poultry, especially at live markets.
Identifying the viruses in Tennessee and China both as H7N9 is similar to having two cars from different states with the same license plate number, said Carol Cardona, avian flu expert at the University of Minnesota.
The strain in Tennessee “is NOT the same as the China H7N9 virus that has impacted poultry and infected humans in Asia,” the USDA emphasized in a statement.
“While the subtype is the same as the China H7N9 lineage that emerged in 2013, this is a different virus and is genetically distinct from the China H7N9 lineage,” the USDA added.
U.S. officials are working to determine how the Tennessee farm, which was a supplier to Tyson Foods Inc, became infected. All 73,500 birds there were killed by the disease or suffocated with foam to prevent its spread.
Tyson, the world’s biggest chicken company, is “hopeful this is an isolated incident,” spokesman Worth Sparkman said.

A flock of 18,000 chickens used for breeding was culled after testing positive for H7 bird flu, according to the agriculture department. It said the birds in far northwestern Georgia were likely infected with a form of the virus that is not highly lethal because the flock did not show signs of illness.
The discovery came after officials in Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee confirmed cases of highly pathogenic, or lethal, and low pathogenic H7N9 bird flu in breeding operations this month. U.S. officials have said the risk of the disease spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe is low.
But the spread of highly pathogenic bird flu to poultry in new states would represent a financial risk for meat companies because it could kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It could also trigger more import bans from other countries after South Korea and other buyers limited U.S. poultry shipments following highly pathogenic cases in Tennessee.
The worst-ever U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu in poultry in 2014 and 2015 killed about 50 million birds, most of which were egg-laying hens in Iowa.
More than 200,000 breeding chickens in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky have been killed in recent weeks by high and low pathogenic bird flu or culled to contain the virus, according to state officials. U.S. poultry producers had about 55.1 million breeder hens on hand as of March 1, according to the USDA.
In 2015, Georgia produced 7.9 billion pounds of chicken meat valued at $4.2 billion, the agency said.
“Poultry is the top sector of our number one industry, agriculture, and we are committed to protecting the livelihoods of the many farm families that are dependent on it,” Gary Black, Georgia’s agriculture commissioner, said in a statement.
Some companies are still feeling pressure related to the 2015 losses.
On Monday, Cal-Maine Foods, the biggest U.S. egg producer, said its quarterly sales fell about 32 percent from a year ago because prices were under pressure after farmers increased production in response to an outbreak two years ago.

A strain of low pathogenic H5N2 avian flu has been discovered in a flock of 84,000 turkeys in Barron County, Wisconsin, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a report posted on the website of the Paris-based OIE.
The USDA said the turkey flock was tested after birds showed signs of depression and the infected premises were quarantined.
The new outbreak comes after the detection of highly pathogenic H7 bird flu last week in a chicken breeder flock in Tennessee farm contracted by U.S. food giant Tyson Foods Inc.
As opposed to highly pathogenic strains which can cause high mortality rates among poultry, low pathogenic ones typically cause few or no clinical signs in birds.
In 2014 and 2015, during a widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu, primarily of the H5N2 strain, the United States killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens. The losses pushed U.S. egg prices to record highs.
The USDA said tests had shown that the H5N2 virus detected in Wisconsin was of North American wild bird origin and distinct from the H5N2 viruses found in 2015.
The risk of human infection in poultry outbreaks is low, although in China more than 110 people died this winter amid an outbreak of the H7N9 virus in birds.
The detection of a first case of bird flu in the United States this year prompted several Asian countries, including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, to limit imports of U.S. poultry.

338,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL2N1GR0NO,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Aviagen [EWESJA.UL], the world’s leading poultry breeding company, has euthanized chickens at a farm in Alabama over concerns about bird flu, the company said on Tuesday, as likely cases of the disease emerged in a top chicken-producing state.
Alabama officials said they suspected that poultry at three sites in the state were infected with the virus, about a week after some 90,500 chickens were culled over infections at two commercial operations across the border in Tennessee.
Aviagen detected the presence of antibodies for the flu virus in a flock in Alabama that showed “no evidence of clinical disease,” company spokeswoman Marla Robinson said in an email. The company is based in Alabama.
The company euthanized the flock and “all eggs which were collected from that farm in the production system were traced and removed,” she said. Aviagen did not respond to a question about how many birds were killed.
Tony Frazier, Alabama’s state veterinarian, said the company chose to cull about 15,000 birds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the farm had 153,000 birds.
A national USDA lab is testing samples from poultry in Alabama to identify the strain of the virus and how lethal it is for birds, after another agency-approved lab identified the H7 subtype of the disease in samples, USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said.
The birds in Alabama did not show clinical signs of sickness, which indicates they did not have a highly lethal, or pathogenic, form of the virus, Cole said.
In Tennessee, both cases were identified as H7N9. The USDA on March 5 confirmed that one was the United States’ first infection of highly pathogenic flu in commercial poultry in a year. Days later, the state said it had found the other case nearby and it was low pathogenic.
Highly pathogenic bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another highly pathogenic outbreak would likely represent a financial blow for poultry operators such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp because it would kill more birds or require flocks to be culled.
It also would likely trigger more import bans from trading partners, after South Korea, Japan and other countries limited imports after the highly pathogenic case in Tennessee.
Health officials have said the risk of bird flu spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe was low.
Separately, Frazier said the owner of a backyard flock suspected of having the virus chose to cull about 70 birds. No poultry linked to the third suspected case, which involved birds at a flea market, have been culled, he said.
Frazier said the cases were still only suspected flu infections and needed to be confirmed by the USDA. Earlier, the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries called a news conference to discuss what it said were three findings of avian influenza.
Alabama raised more than 1 billion chickens for meat in 2015, making it the country’s third largest producer, according to the USDA.
The national USDA laboratory, to which samples from the state were sent, is the only one in the United States that officially confirms cases.
The World Organization for Animal Health requires that all confirmed low-pathogenic H5 and H7 bird flu subtypes be reported because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Highly pathogenic cases also must be reported.

339,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-idUSL2N1GT0Y0,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bird flu that is highly lethal to poultry has infected a second commercial chicken farm in Tennessee that supplies Tyson Foods Inc, company and state officials said on Thursday.
The finding expands an outbreak near the major chicken-producing states of Alabama and Georgia, and is the second in the type of breeder flock crucial for keeping the chicken-meat industry supplied with birds. A case of less dangerous bird flu was confirmed in Alabama on Thursday.
In Tennessee, authorities have started to cull the infected flock of 55,000 chickens in Lincoln County, to contain the highly pathogenic H7N9 flu, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The farm was in a quarantine zone established after authorities this month found the same strain of the disease in a flock of about 73,500 chickens less than 2 miles (3.2 km) away, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture said. That farm also supplied Tyson, the world’s biggest chicken company.
“I’m sure on the part of the company they’re quite concerned and going back and reviewing all of their information and data to determine how in the world this got into the buildings,” said Bret Marsh, state veterinarian in Indiana, which had the nation’s only highly pathogenic bird flu case in poultry in 2016.
The initial case in Tennessee was the nation’s first infection of highly pathogenic bird flu at a commercial operation in more than a year. Tennessee also recently detected a less-dangerous case of low-pathogenic flu in another chicken flock.
On Thursday, Alabama said the USDA confirmed a suspected case of low-pathogenic flu in a guinea fowl at a flea market as H7N9. Aviagen, the world’s largest poultry breeding company, has culled chickens in the state over concerns about the disease.
Highly pathogenic bird flu led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015.
Another widespread outbreak could represent a financial blow for poultry operators because it could kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It also would likely trigger more import bans from trading partners, after South Korea, Japan and other countries limited imports after the first highly pathogenic case in Tennessee.
China has also been grappling with an outbreak of H7N9, which has killed 161 people since October. U.S. authorities have said that strain is genetically distinct from the H7N9 in Tennessee and that the risk of the disease spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe is low.
Tyson said it worked with Tennessee and federal officials to quickly euthanize birds in the infected flock and did not expect disruptions to its chicken supply.
“Our business is diversified and scaled across multiple states, so we plan to meet our customers’ needs,” spokesman Worth Sparkman said.
Tyson shares fell 1.7 percent to close at $62.00 on Thursday.
The company has said it tests all the birds it owns for the virus and flocks diagnosed with highly pathogenic flu are not processed.
Wild birds can carry the disease without showing signs of sickness and transmit it to poultry through feces, feathers or other forms of contract.

340,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu-usa-timeline-idUSL2N15B1SS,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - The first U.S. case of bird flu in poultry in over six months has veterinarians racing to test poultry for the deadly virus to track down any more infections and prevent a massive outbreak.
An Indiana turkey flock was infected with a strain known as H7N8, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Jan. 15.
Last year’s outbreak cost U.S. exporters and producers billions of dollars in lost business as poultry were culled and trading partners limited deals from states and counties with infected flocks. Some countries, including China, halted all imports. Egg prices soared to record highs.
Four states - Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota - declared states of emergency during the outbreak.
Wild birds are thought to be carriers of the virus, which also can be tracked onto poultry farms by people or trucks that come into contact with contaminated feces. It may also be carried into poultry barns by wind blowing in contaminated dirt or dust.
The timeline below shows the spread of the disease in the United States, according to data and information from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and responses by the industry and trade partners.
Dec. 14, 2014 - The first case of the H5N8 strain of bird flu is confirmed in a captive gyrfalcon in Washington state.
Dec. 15 - The first case of H5N2 bird flu is confirmed in a wild bird in Washington state.
Dec. 19 - The H5N8 strain is confirmed for the first time in a backyard flock, in Douglas County, Oregon.
Dec. 20 - South Korea, one of the top buyers of U.S. poultry, halts imports of poultry and poultry products.
Jan. 3, 2015 - The first case of the H5N2 avian influenza strain is confirmed in a backyard flock in Benton County, Washington.
Jan. 6 - Mexico, the largest market for U.S. poultry at $1.2 billion in 2014, bans imports from states with confirmed cases.
Jan. 7 - No. 2 U.S. poultry importer Canada bans imports from affected areas.
Jan. 8 - China bans imports of U.S. poultry, poultry products and eggs.
March 5 - The first case along the Mississippi migratory flyway is confirmed in a commercial flock of 26,310 turkeys in Minnesota, the top U.S. turkey producing state. The flyway runs from the Gulf of Mexico to the northern Midwest along the Mississippi River valley. The virus is thought to be traveling with wild birds as they migrate north.
April 20 - The biggest flock hit so far, as H5N2 is confirmed in 4 million egg-laying hens in Osceola County, Iowa. Mexico expands its import ban to include live birds and eggs from Iowa, the top egg-producer in the United States.
April 29 - A chicken broiler breeding farm in Kossuth County, Iowa, initially tests positive for H5 bird flu, believed to be the first case at a broiler breeding farm.
May 1 - The USDA confirms bird flu in nine more commercial flocks, including a 4.9 million-bird flock of egg-laying hens in Buena Vista County, Iowa, the largest finding to date.
May 5 - U.S. government approves $330 million in emergency funds to fight bird flu spread.
May 11 - The USDA confirms H5N8 avian flu in a backyard poultry flock in Indiana.
May 12 - The USDA confirms H5N2 avian flu at a commercial egg-laying farm in Nebraska.
June 8 - Michigan says Canada geese in the state test positive for lethal strain of bird flu, becoming the sixth state to detect it only in wild or free-ranging birds.

341,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-southkorea-idUSKBN16F0AE,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has culled some 50,000 farm birds as two cases of bird flu were confirmed on Wednesday, bringing the country’s cull this winter to nearly 35 million - more than a fifth of all South Korean poultry - since a first bird flu case was found late last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement that a case of H5N6 avian influenza was discovered at a chicken farm north of Seoul, while another case of the H5N8 strain was found at a duck farm in the southwestern part of the country.
The new cases represent a setback for Korea, fighting its worst-ever bird flu epidemic since mid-November last year. The spread of the virus had appeared to be waning since late January.
Bird flu fears are spreading across the world. Most recently, the United States reported an outbreak, prompting Asian nations including South Korea to halt imports of U.S. poultry.
Korea had not seen any new cases of bird flu for 15 days up to Feb. 22, when an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu virus was confirmed at a duck farm. Since then a total of 13 cases have been reported, the ministry said.

CHICAGO – Top U.S. chicken and egg companies ramped up procedures to protect birds from avian flu on Monday, a day after the federal government confirmed the nation's first case of the virus at a commercial operation in more than a year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday that a farm in southern Tennessee that is a supplier to Tyson Foods Inc had been infected with the virus. All 73,500 birds there were killed by the disease, known as avian influenza (AI), or have since been suffocated with foam to prevent its spread.
The outbreak raised concerns among chicken companies because the infected farm is located near biggest-producing states for chicken meat, including Georgia and Alabama.
The spread of bird flu would represent a financial blow for operators because it would kill birds or require flocks to be culled, and it would trigger more import bans from other countries. Health officials said the risk of avian influenza spreading to people or making food unsafe was extremely remote.
The worst-ever U.S. outbreak of avian flu in 2014 and 2015 killed about 50 million birds, most of which were egg-laying hens in Iowa, but left the southeastern United States largely unscathed.
Already, U.S. trading partners, including South Korea and Japan, have restricted shipments of U.S. poultry because of the infection in Tennessee.
Pilgrim's Pride Corp, the world's second-largest chicken producer, said it ""immediately activated AI response plans and heightened on-farm biosecurity programs at all Pilgrim's facilities"" in response to the case.
Sanderson Farms Inc, the third-largest U.S. poultry producer, cracked down on the movement of people and vehicles into its facilities, said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer.
""Our whole industry from coast to coast has been put on a heightened biosecurity alert,"" said James Sumner, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Tyson shares on Monday closed down 2.5 percent, while Sanderson Farms shares lost 2 percent and Pilgrim's Pride shares dropped 1.2 percent.
'BROILER BELT' CONCERNS
The infected farm housed roosters and hens that produced fertilized eggs, which hatch into the ""broiler"" chickens raised for meat. Often, such facilities have even higher security measures than farms raising birds for slaughter because the breeding animals are more valuable.
""The thing that's worrisome is that it's in the broiler belt,"" said John Glisson, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. ""There are so many birds in this part of the world.""
Just in Alabama, across the border from the infected farm, producers raised more than 1 billion broiler chickens in 2015.
Portions of Alabama are within a zone surrounding the infected farm in which chickens are being tested for avian flu. Tyson collected samples from an Alabama farm in the zone, and they tested negative for the virus, according to the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.
Tyson asked government officials to expand the zone around the farm to 10 miles from 6.2 miles ""to ensure all their commercial operations in the region were disease free,"" said Donna Karlsons, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman. The company manages all the commercial facilities in the region, she said.
Tyson had no immediate comment. On Sunday, the company said it was working with state and federal officials to contain the virus.
Of eight chicken houses on the farm in Tennessee, one became infected, said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, an industry group. That indicates ""the farmer obviously was practicing pretty good biosecurity,"" he said.
The farmer will bury the remains of the dead chickens on his property, said Glisson.
Wild birds, such as ducks, can carry avian flu without showing symptoms of it and spread it to commercial farms through feces or feathers.
In recent months, different strains of the virus have been confirmed in birds across the northern hemisphere, leading authorities worldwide to cull millions of animals. Several people have died in an outbreak of avian flu in China.
The strain that struck the Tennessee had a North American wild bird lineage, according to the USDA.
The USDA said it did not know how the farm in Tennessee became infected or the strain involved.
""We have been reading of the spread of bird flu in Asia and Europe, and now to be confirmed here in the U.S. is of serious concern,"" said Ken Klippen, president of the National Association of Egg Farmers.
Rose Acre Farms, the second-largest U.S. egg producer, raised its risk level to ""tightest you can get"" after the Tennessee case was detected, Chief Executive Marcus Rust said. Trucks must wait 72 hours to enter the company's property if they come from an area with avian flu, up from 24 hours, he said.",3
343,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKCN0V62QS?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - In the two weeks since bird flu reappeared in Indiana, U.S. veterinarians have swabbed the mouths of chickens and turkeys across the country, racing to uncover any more infections and contain the virus before it causes mass death and damage like last year.
Biologists also are running tests on feces collected from wild birds, which are suspected of spreading the disease to farms.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on Jan. 15 that a turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, was infected with the H7N8 strain of the virus. It was the first new case of bird flu in U.S. poultry flocks since June.
More poultry flocks will likely fall ill in the coming months, veterinarians said, following an unprecedented outbreak last year that caused more than 48 million chickens and turkeys to die from sickness or because they had to be culled to contain the disease.
Anxiety over that risk is fueling vigilance among U.S. poultry producers and government officials looking for signs of infections. Increased testing could help limit the spread if new cases are detected quickly.
“Everybody’s testing everything,” said John Glisson, vice-president of research for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, an industry group.
In the days after the latest outbreak, when winter weather was hampering travel, the USDA arranged for a plane to fly poultry samples from farms near the infected site in Indiana to an Iowa lab to speed up testing, said Denise Derrer, spokeswoman for the Indiana Board of Animal Health.
Typically, the samples would be driven across Illinois.
State and federal authorities culled more than 400,000 birds near the infected farm to contain the outbreak. About 350,000 in the area were killed even though they were diagnosed with a less lethal form of bird flu or tested negative for the disease.
Officials said they wanted to be aggressive to avoid a repeat of last year’s losses. USDA believes the less lethal virus type mutated into a more deadly strain in one flock.
Indiana has required testing in flocks as far as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the infected farm at least every five to seven days, exceeding the USDA’s standard requirement for testing confined to a zone half that size.
Last year showed the passage of a few weeks without a new infection did not mean the end of the virus.
Minnesota, the nation’s top turkey producing state, confirmed its first infection in poultry on March 5. Its next case was not detected until March 27, and the state subsequently lost 5 million turkeys.
“We’re constantly reminded of what happened in Minnesota last year,” Derrer said.

A farm in southern Tennessee that produces chickens for Tyson Foods was ordered to cull its flock after federal officials on Sunday identified an outbreak of lethal avian influenza there, the first time the disease has struck this year.
Some 73,500 birds had to be culled over the weekend at the farm in Lincoln County, Tenn., an operation raising so-called breeder birds, which lay the eggs that become chickens for meat. The Department of Agriculture has not yet fully identified the specific strain of the H7 virus found at the farm.
The U.S.D.A. has also established a quarantine on chicken farms around the area, and Tyson said it was testing chickens on such farms to determine whether the disease had spread.
“All flocks located within a six-mile radius of the farm will be tested and will not be transported unless they test negative for the virus,” Tyson said in a statement on its website. “Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business.”
Tyson also said this was “a bird health issue and not a food safety or human health concern,” adding that “there’s no evidence to suggest that any form of avian influenza can be transmitted to humans from properly cooked poultry.”
Other major chicken producers told Bloomberg News that they were increasing biosecurity measures across their operations.
An avian flu epidemic led to the culling of some 48 million chickens and turkeys from late 2014 through mid-2015, dealing a crippling blow to American egg producers, as well as to some turkey producers and backyard poultry growers. Authorities believe migratory birds are primarily responsible for spreading avian influenza, though a 2015 analysis by the U.S.D.A. also described a human role in spreading the disease.
The broiler chicken business escaped that outbreak, and in general is less susceptible to avian flu because its birds, which are used for meat, are slaughtered at 45 to 60 days old, so the birds rotate out of barns far more quickly. Broilers are also raised in flocks of tens of thousands of birds, whereas barns used for egg production can house 300,000 or more birds.
Last year, there was one reported incident of deadly avian flu in the United States, which affected a turkey farm in Indiana. The poultry industry has increased its biosecurity efforts since 2015, establishing practices for cleaning transport trucks before they enter a facility and limiting access to essential workers.
South Korea was the first country to announce a ban on imports of United States chicken and eggs after the announcement of the Tennessee outbreak. The country has itself been fighting an avian flu outbreak, culling 34 million birds so far this year.",3

The cases in Alabama are suspected to be the less dangerous form of the disease, known as low pathogenic, because the infected flocks did not have high levels of mortality, said Ray Hilburn, associate director of the Alabama Poultry and Egg Association, an industry group.
The flocks were near the spot in southern Tennessee where the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on March 5 the nation's first case of highly pathogenic flu in commercial poultry in more than a year. Days later, Tennessee said it had detected low-pathogenic flu at another chicken farm nearby.
Highly pathogenic bird flu is often fatal for domesticated poultry and led to the deaths of about 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens, in the United States in 2014 and 2015. The less-serious low pathogenic flu form can cause coughing, depression and other symptoms in birds.
The spread of highly pathogenic flu could represent a financial blow for poultry operators such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim's Pride Corp because it would kill more birds or require flocks to be culled. It also would trigger more import bans from other countries, after South Korea, Japan and other nations limited imports following the highly pathogenic case in Tennessee.
Alabama has not received any definitive test results that show its cases are highly pathogenic, said Amy Belcher, spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries. No epidemiological connections have been made between the cases in Tennessee and Alabama, she added.
Belcher declined to discuss culling of the birds ahead of a news conference on bird flu, or avian influenza (AI), in the state on Tuesday.
Hilburn said infected birds had been culled but did not know how many. He said one case in Alabama was at a commercial breeding facility for chickens raised for meat and one involved a backyard flock.
""As soon as they find out that its possibly any type of AI, they're going to get rid of the birds,"" Hilburn said. ""They don't take a chance on anything.""
Health officials have said the risk of bird flu spreading to people from poultry or making food unsafe was low. (Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Frances Kerry)

The United States reported an outbreak of low-pathogenic H7N3 bird flu on a turkey farm in California, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said on Wednesday.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report posted on the OIE website that a commercial turkey flock had exhibited coughing with a slight increase in mortality. Samples were submitted for laboratory testing and were confirmed positive for H7N3 avian influenza.
The infected premises was placed under quarantine following preliminary findings and an epidemiological investigation was initiated, it said. Follow-up surveillance and testing on 10 epidemiologically associated farms was negative bird flu.

The Tennessee Department of Agriculture reported this month that two commercial chicken flocks had been found to have been infected with H7N9 highly pathogenic flu.
In a statement carried by the Saudi state news agency SPA, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture said the ban was issued in accordance with a warning issued by the World Organisation of Animal Health and would remain in place “until it is certain that they are free from the disease”.
The Tennessee Department of Agriculture said on March 16 that a flock in Lincoln County was found to have been infected with H7N9, the same strain that was reported in another chicken flock less than two miles away on March 5.
The initial case was the country’s first infection of highly pathogenic bird flu at a commercial poultry operation in more than a year.

351,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16E01B,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Top U.S. chicken and egg companies ramped up procedures to protect birds from avian flu on Monday, a day after the federal government confirmed the nation’s first case of the virus at a commercial operation in more than a year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday that a farm in southern Tennessee that is a supplier to Tyson Foods Inc had been infected with the virus. All 73,500 birds there were killed by the disease, known as avian influenza (AI), or have since been suffocated with foam to prevent its spread.
The outbreak raised concerns among chicken companies because the infected farm is located near biggest-producing states for chicken meat, including Georgia and Alabama.
The spread of bird flu would represent a financial blow for operators because it would kill birds or require flocks to be culled, and it would trigger more import bans from other countries. Health officials said the risk of avian influenza spreading to people or making food unsafe was extremely remote.
The worst-ever U.S. outbreak of avian flu in 2014 and 2015 killed about 50 million birds, most of which were egg-laying hens in Iowa, but left the southeastern United States largely unscathed.
Already, U.S. trading partners, including South Korea and Japan, have restricted shipments of U.S. poultry because of the infection in Tennessee.
Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, the world’s second-largest chicken producer, said it “immediately activated AI response plans and heightened on-farm biosecurity programs at all Pilgrim’s facilities” in response to the case.
Sanderson Farms Inc, the third-largest U.S. poultry producer, cracked down on the movement of people and vehicles into its facilities, said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer.
“Our whole industry from coast to coast has been put on a heightened biosecurity alert,” said James Sumner, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Tyson shares on Monday closed down 2.5 percent, while Sanderson Farms shares lost 2 percent and Pilgrim’s Pride shares dropped 1.2 percent.
‘BROILER BELT’ CONCERNS
The infected farm housed roosters and hens that produced fertilized eggs, which hatch into the “broiler” chickens raised for meat. Often, such facilities have even higher security measures than farms raising birds for slaughter because the breeding animals are more valuable.
“The thing that’s worrisome is that it’s in the broiler belt,” said John Glisson, vice president of research for the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. “There are so many birds in this part of the world.”
Just in Alabama, across the border from the infected farm, producers raised more than 1 billion broiler chickens in 2015.
Portions of Alabama are within a zone surrounding the infected farm in which chickens are being tested for avian flu. Tyson collected samples from an Alabama farm in the zone, and they tested negative for the virus, according to the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.
Tyson asked government officials to expand the zone around the farm to 10 miles from 6.2 miles “to ensure all their commercial operations in the region were disease free,” said Donna Karlsons, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman. The company manages all the commercial facilities in the region, she said.
Tyson had no immediate comment. On Sunday, the company said it was working with state and federal officials to contain the virus.
Of eight chicken houses on the farm in Tennessee, one became infected, said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, an industry group. That indicates “the farmer obviously was practicing pretty good biosecurity,” he said.
The farmer will bury the remains of the dead chickens on his property, said Glisson.
Wild birds, such as ducks, can carry avian flu without showing symptoms of it and spread it to commercial farms through feces or feathers.
In recent months, different strains of the virus have been confirmed in birds across the northern hemisphere, leading authorities worldwide to cull millions of animals. Several people have died in an outbreak of avian flu in China.
The strain that struck the Tennessee had a North American wild bird lineage, according to the USDA.
The USDA said it did not know how the farm in Tennessee became infected or the strain involved.
“We have been reading of the spread of bird flu in Asia and Europe, and now to be confirmed here in the U.S. is of serious concern,” said Ken Klippen, president of the National Association of Egg Farmers.
Rose Acre Farms, the second-largest U.S. egg producer, raised its risk level to “tightest you can get” after the Tennessee case was detected, Chief Executive Marcus Rust said. Trucks must wait 72 hours to enter the company’s property if they come from an area with avian flu, up from 24 hours, he said.

CHICAGO, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexico, the biggest buyer of U.S. chicken, and other major countries imposed new import restrictions on Thursday after a virulent form of bird flu was found at the heart of America’s poultry region.
The virus’ discovery in Arkansas is expected to prompt similar moves by up to 40 more countries, and the restrictions are likely to depress prices and hurt U.S. poultry producers, economists said.
Top U.S. poultry producers like JBS SA unit Pilgrim’s Pride Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc downplayed the risk to operations, but the Arkansas case sent their shares tumbling on Wednesday ahead of an official confirmation.
“We will see some markets shutting their imports, mainly from that state, but not from the whole country,” said Wesley Batista, chief executive officer of meats company JBS SA .
Fearing the virus’ spread, Mexico, Canada and the European Union, along with other importers, on Thursday banned poultry imports from Arkansas. Missouri, Minnesota, California, Washington state and Oregon already face bans or restrictions.
China and South Korea have total bans on U.S. poultry exports from prior avian flu cases.
After recent cases in a handful of other states, the U.S. government on Wednesday confirmed the infection of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu in turkeys in Arkansas, home to Tyson Foods Inc, the world’s biggest chicken company. The virus is unlikely to kill enough U.S. birds to offset the drop in overseas demand due to trade bans.
While the H5N2 strain poses no threat to humans, according to the USDA, it is deadly to poultry. Avian flu can spread rapidly through a flock, killing birds in as little as 24 hours.
The USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, an industry group, said it expected 30 to 40 additional countries to impose new trade restrictions on U.S. poultry and eggs in the $5.7 billion export market.
There will be “more product on the domestic market and that will depress prices,” said Jessica Sampson, agricultural economist at Livestock Marketing Information Center.
The United States exports about 20 percent of the chicken it produces and about 14 percent of the turkey produced, according to the center.
Last year, China and South Korea accounted for about $428.5 million in export sales of poultry meat and products, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
With the export market already hit by the strong dollar, “we don’t need anything else that would make those exports any softer,” said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms.
Shares in Sanderson, Tyson and Pilgrim’s Pride were flat to lower on Thursday.
So far, viral strains of bird flu have been identified mostly in wild birds and commercial turkey farms, predominantly west of the Rocky Mountains. But the industry has been on alert since Minnesota and Missouri confirmed cases in the past week.
Minnesota is the nation’s leading turkey producer, while Arkansas ranks third and Missouri is fifth, according to the USDA. The poultry sector fears the virus could spread through the much bigger domestic chicken industry. Arkansas is the third-largest chicken producer.
PRICING QUESTIONS
Poultry companies have been enjoying large profits recently thanks to high meat prices and declining feed costs. In January, Tyson reported operating income of $351 million for its chicken business in the quarter ended Dec. 27, up almost 40 percent on the year.
Trade restrictions could drive down prices by 5 percent to 10 percent in the United States for dark meat, which makes up the majority of chicken exports, said H.L. Goodwin, a poultry economist at the University of Arkansas.
How poultry companies will handle such pricing woes is not yet known. At North Carolina-based Butterball LLC, a “limited number” of turkeys from farms in Missouri and Arkansas that supply birds to the company have been diagnosed with H5N2 bird flu, according to a statement.
The company, which accounts for 20 percent of all U.S. turkey production, declined to comment on its pricing.
Tyson also declined to discuss the impact bird flu may have on the company but said no flocks grown for Tyson have been diagnosed with the virus.
Tyson “has the ability to ship products from multiple states, so we believe we can meet demand for both domestic and global markets,” company spokesman Worth Sparkman said.

356,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-southkorea-idUSKBN16D2HE,"SEOUL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have limited imports of U.S. poultry after the United States detected its first case this year of avian flu on a commercial chicken farm, South Korea’s government and a U.S. trade group said on Monday.
South Korea will ban imports of U.S. poultry and eggs after a strain of H7 bird flu virus was confirmed on Sunday at a chicken farm in Tennessee, South Korea’s agriculture ministry said.
Japan and Taiwan will block poultry from the state, while Hong Kong will restrict imports from the Tennessee county where the infected flock was located, said James Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, a trade group.
The limits will reduce the potential for major U.S. chicken companies, such as Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N and Pilgrim's Pride PPC.O, to sell poultry overseas.
The Tennessee farm infected with avian flu was contracted to sell birds to Tyson.
South Korea’s import ban took effect on Monday, the agriculture ministry said in a statement. Live poultry and eggs are subject to the ban, while heat-treated chicken meat and egg products can still be imported, the statement noted.
South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, has been importing eggs from the United States as its worst-ever bird flu, or avian influenza (AI), outbreak has tightened the country’s egg supplies.
The latest moves do not affect China, which introduced a ban on imports of U.S. poultry and eggs in late 2015.
So far this year South Korea has shipped in nearly 1,049 tonnes of U.S. eggs, according to ministry data, accounting for more than 98 percent of its total egg imports as of March 3.
Sumner said South Korea’s decision to prohibit shipments of U.S. shell eggs was disappointing. Its move to continue imports of certain processed egg products was “good because Korea’s got this terrible AI problem and they were definitely in need of eggs,” he said.
South Korea resumed U.S. poultry imports in June last year after imposing a ban in early 2016 when bird flu cases were detected in the United States.
The resumption of the U.S. import ban means South Korea can import chicken meat from Brazil, Chile, Australia, Canada, the Philippines and Thailand.
Live poultry imports are limited to farm birds from New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

359,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-containment-idUSKBN0MC0BN20150316,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are considering imposing tougher restrictions in Arkansas to contain a virulent strain of avian flu in the heart of America’s poultry region in a bid to minimize international trade disruptions and contain the virus.
The H5N2 flu discovered in Arkansas last week is the state’s first case of a strain that causes massive internal hemorrhaging in poultry, can kill nearly every bird in an infected flock within 48 hours, and is prone to mutate. Such strains are sometimes called “chicken Ebola.”
In response, Arkansas is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to create new rules for commercial poultry producers and owners of backyard flocks alike, Reuters has learned.
The rules will spell out how often poultry within a quarantine zone must test negative for bird flu before the quarantine can be lifted, Brandon Doss, Arkansas’ assistant state veterinarian, said. Until the quarantine is lifted, no poultry within 10 km (6 miles) around the farm that was infected with bird flu can move in or out of the area.
The rules being revised were previously used to deal with less deadly strains of the bird flu in Arkansas.
U.S. authorities are seeking to reassure major buyers of U.S. chicken, such as Mexico, which imposed new import restrictions last week. The export market for companies like Tyson Foods Inc and JBS SA unit Pilgrim’s Pride Corp is worth $5.7 billion annually.
Already, Arkansas has established a quarantine zone around a farm infected with H5N2 and ordered a 24-hour guard to monitor trucks and people entering and leaving the site and block unauthorized access.
“In all likelihood it will be our largest response effort to date,” Doss said. Arkansas has 42 commercial operations and at least two dozen backyard flocks to monitor within its quarantine zone.
Other states with recent H5N2 cases, including Minnesota and Missouri, have also established quarantine zones around infected farms and are testing nearby flocks in line with existing U.S. requirements.
Kansas last week imposed a quarantine in two counties even before a case of the flu was confirmed on Friday. They took action because of worry about an infection in neighboring Missouri.
GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR
But it is the Arkansas infection, in particular, that is causing concern among poultry producers and investors in chicken companies like Tyson and Sanderson Farms Inc, because the state is among the top chicken and turkey producers and is near other major poultry states like Mississippi and Alabama.
Arkansas poultry have previously suffered from milder cases of low pathogenic avian flu, which can cause reduced egg production and respiratory difficulties, among other symptoms. During those outbreaks, flocks needed to test negative for the virus in a minimum of two tests administered 10 days apart before quarantines were lifted, Doss said.
For the more deadly strain discovered last week, “we have not set that time frame or that protocol yet,” he said. “It is still in development with USDA.”
It is not known whether states other than Arkansas are working with the USDA on new surveillance protocols.
Butterball LLC, the largest U.S. producer of turkey products, contracts to buy birds from the Arkansas farm infected with the virus.
Arkansas livestock inspectors, divided into six teams of two people, are going door-to-door to nearly 1,900 properties within the quarantine zone to search for backyard flocks that could potentially be infected, Doss said.
As of late on Friday, they had visited 256 properties and identified 24 with backyard flocks. All will be subject to the new protocols under discussion by the USDA and the state.

360,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16E1D9,"PARIS (Reuters) - The United States reported an outbreak of avian flu on a farm in Wisconsin, the second in the country in less than a week although the virus found this time is considered less virulent, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Tuesday.
A strain of low pathogenic H5N2 avian flu has been discovered in a flock of 84,000 turkeys in Barron County, Wisconsin, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a report posted on the website of the Paris-based OIE.
The USDA said the turkey flock was tested after birds showed signs of depression and the infected premises were quarantined.
The new outbreak comes after the detection of highly pathogenic H7 bird flu last week in a chicken breeder flock in Tennessee farm contracted by U.S. food giant Tyson Foods Inc.
As opposed to highly pathogenic strains which can cause high mortality rates among poultry, low pathogenic ones typically cause few or no clinical signs in birds.
In 2014 and 2015, during a widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu, primarily of the H5N2 strain, the United States killed nearly 50 million birds, mostly egg-laying hens. The losses pushed U.S. egg prices to record highs.
The USDA said tests had shown that the H5N2 virus detected in Wisconsin was of North American wild bird origin and distinct from the H5N2 viruses found in 2015.
The risk of human infection in poultry outbreaks is low, although in China more than 110 people died this winter amid an outbreak of the H7N9 virus in birds.
The detection of a first case of bird flu in the United States this year prompted several Asian countries, including South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, to limit imports of U.S. poultry.
